After installing cluster logging into your {product-title} cluster, you can make the following configurations.

[NOTE]
====
You must set cluster logging to Unmanaged state before performing these configurations, unless otherwise noted.
For more information, see xref:../../logging/config/cluster-logging-management.adoc#cluster-logging-management[Changing the cluster logging management state].

Operators in an unmanaged state are unsupported and the cluster administrator assumes full control of the individual component configurations and upgrades.
