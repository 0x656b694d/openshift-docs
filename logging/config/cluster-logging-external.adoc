= Sending logs to external devices using Fluentd plug-ins
include::modules/common-attributes.adoc[]

toc::[]

{product-title} cluster logging allows you to configure Fluentd plug-ins to send logs to external devices. 

* *out_foward*. You can use this plug-in to send logs to an external log aggregator.
* *fluent-plugin-remote-syslog*. You can use this plug-in to send logs to external syslog server.

[NOTE]
====
You can use the xref:../../logging/config/cluster-logging-log-forwarding.adoc#cluster-logging-log-forwarding[Log Forwarding feature] that can be easier to configure than the plugins. Note that Log Forwardinging is currently in Technology Preview.
