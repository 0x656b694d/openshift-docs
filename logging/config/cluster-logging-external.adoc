= Sending logs to external devices using Fluentd Forward plug-ins
include::modules/common-attributes.adoc[]

toc::[]

{product-title} cluster logging allows you to configure the Fluentd *out_forward* plug-in to send logs to external devices. 

You can use the xref:../../logging/config/cluster-logging-log-forwarding.adoc#cluster-logging-log-forwarding[log forwarding feature], which can be easier to configure than the plugins. Note that the log forwarding feature is currently in Technology Preview.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Changes introduced by the new log forward feature modified the support for *out_forward* starting with the {product-title} 4.3 release. In {product-title} 4.3, you create a ConfigMap to configure *out_forward*, as described below, instead of editing the `secure-forward.conf` section in the `fluentd` ConfigMap. You can add any certificates required by your external devices to a secret, called `secure-forward`, which is mounted to the Fluentd Pods.

When you update to {product-title} 4.3, any existing modifications to the `secure-forward.conf` section of the `fluentd` ConfigMap are removed. You can copy your current `secure-forward.conf` section before updating to use when creating the `secure-forward` ConfigMap.
