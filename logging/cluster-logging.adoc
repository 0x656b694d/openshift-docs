ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-webscale,openshift-origin[]
As a cluster administrator, you can deploy cluster logging to
aggregate all the logs from your {product-title} cluster, such as node system audit logs, application container logs, and infrastructure logs.
Cluster logging aggregates these logs from throughout your cluster and stores them in a default log store. You can xref:../logging/viewing/cluster-logging-viewing.adoc#cluster-logging-viewing[view the logs in a console or the {product-title} web console] or xref:../logging/viewing/cluster-logging-visualizer.adoc#cluster-logging-visualizer[use Kibana to visualize log data].
endif::[]

ifdef::openshift-dedicated[]
As an administrator, you can deploy cluster logging to
aggregate logs for a range of {product-title} services.

Cluster logging runs on worker nodes. As an
 administrator, you can monitor resource consumption in the
console and via Prometheus and Grafana. Due to the high work load required for
logging, more worker nodes may be required for your environment.

Logs in {product-title} are retained for seven days before rotation. Logging
storage is capped at 600GiB. This is independent of a cluster's allocated base
storage.
