After upgrading the {product-title} cluster from 4.1 to 4.2, you must then upgrade cluster logging from 4.1 to 4.2.

[NOTE]
====
Because of a xref:../release_notes/ocp-4-2-release-notes.adoc#ocp-4-2-global-catalog-namespace[change in the default global catalog Namespace and Catalog Source], if you manaully created CatalogSourceConfig and Subscription objects from YAML files, as described by the xref:../logging/cluster-logging-deploying.adoc#cluster-logging-deploy-eo-cli_cluster-logging-deploying[Elasticsearch installation], you need to update these objects to point to the new catalog Namespace and Source before upgrading, as shown below.
