With the OpenShift command line interface (CLI), you can create and manage OpenShift projects from a terminal. The CLI is ideal in situations where you are:

* Working directly with project source code
* Scripting OpenShift operations
* Restricted by bandwidth resources and cannot use the web console

The CLI commands are available directly from the OpenShift binary with the following syntax:

****
`openshift cli [replaceable]#<command>#`
****

However, if `osc` is available on your workstation you can use it as a shortcut in place of `openshift cli` in the command syntax:

****
`osc [replaceable]#<command>#`
****

NOTE: Although `osc` is used in the command examples presented throughout this document, you can substitute `openshift cli` in the command syntax if `osc` is not available on your workstation.
