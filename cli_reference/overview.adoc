With the OpenShift command line interface (CLI), you can create applications and
manage OpenShift projects from a terminal. The CLI is ideal in situations where
you are:

* Working directly with project source code.
* Scripting OpenShift operations.
* Restricted by bandwidth resources and cannot use the Management Console.

The OpenShift CLI is available using the `osc` binary:

****
`$ osc _<command>_`
****

NOTE: The CLI command examples presented through OpenShift documentation use
`osc` command syntax. If the `osc` binary is not available on your workstation,
you can alternatively substitute `openshift cli` in the examples if you
have the `openshift` binary.
