With the OpenShift command line interface (CLI), you can
xref:../dev_guide/new_app.adoc#dev-guide-new-app[create applications] and manage OpenShift
xref:../dev_guide/projects.adoc#dev-guide-projects[projects] from a terminal. The CLI is ideal in
situations where you are:

- Working directly with project source code.
- Scripting OpenShift operations.
- Restricted by bandwidth resources and cannot use the
xref:../architecture/infrastructure_components/web_console.adoc#architecture-infrastructure-components-web-console[web console].

The OpenShift CLI is available using the `oc` command:

----
$ oc <command>
----

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
You can download and unpack the CLI with an active OpenShift Enterprise
subscription from the
https://access.redhat.com/downloads/content/290[Red
Hat Customer Portal].
endif::[]

ifdef::openshift-origin[]
You can download and unpack the CLI from the
https://github.com/openshift/origin/releases[Releases page] of the OpenShift
Origin source repository on GitHub.
endif::[]

[NOTE]
====
The CLI command examples presented through OpenShift documentation use
`oc` command syntax. If the `oc` binary is not available on your workstation,
you can alternatively substitute `openshift cli` in the examples if you
have the `openshift` binary.
