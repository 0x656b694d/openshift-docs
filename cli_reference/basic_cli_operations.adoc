== Overview
This topic provides information on some general CLI operations and their syntax.
You must link:get_started_cli.html[setup and login] with the CLI before you can
perform these operations.

== Common Operations
The CLI allows interaction with the various objects that are managed by
OpenShift. Many common `oc` operations are invoked using the following syntax:

----
$ oc <action> <object_type> <object_name_or_id>
----

This specifies:

- An `_<action>_` to perform, such as `get` or `describe`.
- The `_<object_type>_` to perform the action on, such as `service` or the abbreviated `svc`.
- The `_<object_name_or_id>_` of the specified `_<object_type>_`.

For example, the `oc get` operation returns a complete list of services that
are currently defined:

====

[options="nowrap"]
----
$ oc get svc
NAME              LABELS                                    SELECTOR                  IP              PORT(S)
docker-registry   docker-registry=default                   docker-registry=default   172.30.78.158   5000/TCP
kubernetes        component=apiserver,provider=kubernetes   <none>                    172.30.0.2      443/TCP
kubernetes-ro     component=apiserver,provider=kubernetes   <none>                    172.30.0.1      80/TCP
----
====

The `oc describe` operation can then be used to return detailed information
about a specific object:

====

[options="nowrap"]
----
$ oc describe svc docker-registry
Name:			docker-registry
Labels:			docker-registry=default
Selector:		docker-registry=default
IP:			172.30.78.158
Port:			<unnamed>	5000/TCP
Endpoints:		10.1.0.2:5000
Session Affinity:	None
No events.
----
====

The following table describes common `oc` operations and their general syntax:

.Common CLI Operations
[cols=".^2,.^5,8",options="header"]
|===

|Operation |Syntax |Description

|`get`
|`oc get _<object_type>_ _<object_name_or_id>_`
|Returns a list of objects for the specified link:#object-types[object type]. If
the optional `_<object_name_or_id>_` is included in the request, then the list
of results is filtered by that value.

|`describe`
|`oc describe _<object_type>_ _<object_id>_`
|Returns information about the specific object returned by the query; a specific
`_<object_name_or_id>_` must be provided. The actual information that is
available varies as described in link:#object-types[object type].

|`create`
|`oc create -f _<file_or_directory_path>_`
|Parses a configuration file and creates one or more OpenShift objects based on
the file contents. The `-f` flag can be passed multiple times with different
file or directory paths. When the flag is passed multiple times, `oc create`
iterates through each one, creating the objects described in all of the
indicated files. Any existing resources are ignored.

|`scale`
|`oc scale _<object_type>_ _<object_id>_ --replicas=_<#_of_replicas>_`
|Sets the number of desired replicas for a
link:../architecture/core_objects/kubernetes_model.html#replication-controller[replication
controller] or a link:../dev_guide/deployments.html[deployment configuration] to
`_<#_of_replicas>_`.

|`update`
|`oc update -f _<file_or_directory_path>_`
|Attempts to modify an existing object based on the contents of the specified
configuration file. The -f flag can be passed multiple times with different file
or directory paths. When the flag is passed multiple times, `oc update`
iterates through each one, updating the objects described in all of the
indicated files.

|`delete`
a|`oc delete -f _<file_path>_`

`oc delete _<object_type>_ _<object_name_or_id>_`

`oc delete _<object_type>_ -l _<label>_`

`oc delete all -l _<label>_`
.^|Deletes the specified OpenShift object. An object configuration can also be
passed in through STDIN. The `oc delete all -l _<label>_` operation deletes all
objects matching the specified `_<label>_`, including the
link:../architecture/core_objects/kubernetes_model.html#replication-controller[replication
controller] so that pods are not re-created.

|`expose`
|`oc expose _<object_type>_ _<object_name_or_id>_`
|Looks up a service and exposes it as a route. There is also the ability to
expose a deployment configuration, replication controller, service, or pod as a
new service on a specified port. If no labels are specified, the new object will
re-use the labels from the object it exposes.


|`logs`
|`oc logs -f _<pod_name>_ _<container_name>_`
|Retrieves the log output for a specific pod or container. This command does not
work for other object types.

|`label`
|`oc label _<object_type>_ _<object_name_or_id>_ _<label>_`
|Updates the labels on a object.

|`stop`
a|`oc stop -f _<file_path>_`

`oc stop _<object_type>_ _<object_name_or_id>_`

`oc stop _<object_type>_ -l _<label>_`

`oc stop all -l _<label>_`
.^|Gracefully shuts down an object by ID or file name. Attempts to shut down and
delete an object that supports graceful termination.
|===

== Object Types
The CLI supports the following object types, some of which have abbreviated
syntax:

.Supported Object Types
[options="header"]
|===

|Object Type |Abbreviated Version

|`build` |
|`buildConfig` | `bc`
|`deploymentConfig` | `dc`
|`imageStream` | `is`
|`imageStreamTag` | `istag`
|`imageStreamImage` | `isimage`
|`event` |`ev`
|`node` |
|`pod` |`po`
|`replicationController` |`rc`
|`service` |`svc`
|`persistentVolume` |`pv`
|`persistentVolumeClaim` |`pvc`
|===

== Project Operations
These advanced operations for administrators are used to define and instantiate
OpenShift objects at the project level.

The simplest way to create a new project is:

----
$ oc new-project <project_name> --display-name=<display_name>
--description=<description> --admin=<admin_username>
--node-selector=<node_label_selector>
----

The following example creates a new project called `test` that appears in the
web console as "OpenShift 3 Sample". `test-admin` is the project administrator
and, when launched onto nodes, pods receive the matching label of `environment :
test`:

====
----
$ oc new-project test --display-name="OpenShift 3 Sample" --description="This
is an example project to demonstrate OpenShift v3"
--admin=anypassword:test-admin --node-selector="environment=test"
----
====

.Project CLI Operations
[cols=".^2,.^5,8",options="header"]
|===

|Operation |Syntax |Description

|`process`
|`oc process -f _<template_file_path>_`
|Transforms a project template into a project configuration file.

|`apply`
|`oc apply -f _<config_file_path>_`
|Creates all of the OpenShift objects for a given project based on the specified configuration file.
|===

== Build Operations
One of the fundamental capabilities of OpenShift is the ability to build
applications into a container from source. The following table describes the CLI
operations for working with application builds:

.Build CLI Operations
[cols=".^2,.^5,8",options="header"]
|===

|Operation |Syntax |Description

|`start-build`
|`oc start-build _<buildConfig_name>_`
|Manually starts the build process with the specified build configuration file.

|`start-build`
|`oc start-build --from-build=_<build_name>_`
|Manually starts the build process by specifying the name of a previous build as a starting point.

|`start-build`
a|`oc start-build _<buildConfig_name>_ --follow`

`oc start-build --from-build=_<build_name>_ --follow`
|Manually starts the build process by specifying either a configuration file pr the name of a previous build _and_ retrieves its build logs.

|`cancel-build`
|`oc cancel-build _<build_name>_`
|Stops a build that is in progress.

|`build-logs`
|`oc build-logs _<build_name>_`
|Retrieves the build logs for the specified build.
|===

== Deployment Operations
OpenShift provides CLI access to inspect and manipulate
link:../dev_guide/deployments.html[deployment configurations] using standard
`oc` resource operations, such as `get`, `create`, and `describe`.

Use the `oc describe` command to describe a deployment configuration in
human-readable form:

----
$ oc describe dc <deployment_config>
----

The following example describes a deployment configuration called
`docker-registry`:

====

[options="nowrap"]
----
$ oc describe dc docker-registry
Name:		docker-registry
Created:	18 hours ago
Labels:		docker-registry=default
Latest Version:	1
Triggers:	Config
Strategy:	Recreate
Template:
	Selector:	docker-registry=default
	Replicas:	1
	Containers:
		NAME		IMAGE					ENV
		registry	openshift/origin-docker-registry:v0.4.3	OPENSHIFT_CA_DATA=[omitted for space],OPENSHIFT_MASTER=https://10.245.2.2:8443
Latest Deployment:
	Name:		docker-registry-1
	Status:		Complete
	Selector:	deployment=docker-registry-1,deploymentconfig=docker-registry,docker-registry=default
	Labels:		docker-registry=default
	Replicas:	1 current / 1 desired
	Pods Status:	1 Running / 0 Waiting / 0 Succeeded / 0 Failed
----
====

=== Deployment Rollbacks

Rollbacks revert an application back to a previous deployment, and they include
environment variable and volumes. Therefore, consider the following when deciding whether a rollback is viable or not:

- If security credentials have been recently updated, the previous deployment
may not have the correct values.
- If the previous deployment used a custom strategy which is no longer available
or usable, the deployment may not be deployed correctly.

During a rollback, only the configuration of pods and containers is changed by
default, while the scaling or trigger settings remain unchanged.

The `-d` or `--dry run` option shows the configuration of the updated deployment
in an easy to read format without actually executing the rollback. This allows
you to inspect the output before actually proceeding with the rollback.

Use the `oc rollback` command to revert part of an application back to a
previous deployment:

----
$ oc rollback <deployment> [<options>]
----

.Rollback CLI Configuration Options
[cols="4,8",options="header"]
|===

|Option |Description

.^|`--change-triggers`
|Include the previous deployment's triggers in the rollback.

.^|`--change-strategy`
|Include the previous deployment's strategy in the rollback.

.^|`-d, --dry-run`
|Instead of performing the rollback, describe what the rollback will look like in human-readable form.

.^|`-o, --output`
|Instead of performing the rollback, print the updated deployment configuration in the specified format: `json`\|`yaml`\|`template`\|`templatefile`.

.^|`-t, --template`
|Template string or path to template file to use when `-o=template` or `-o=templatefile`.
|===

To perform a rollback:

====

----
$ oc rollback deployment-1
----
====

To see what the rollback will look like without performing the rollback:

====

----
$ oc rollback deployment-1 --dry-run
----
====

To perform the rollback manually by piping the *JSON* of the new configuration back to `oc`:

====

[options="nowrap"]
----
$ oc rollback deployment-1 --output=json | oc update deploymentConfigs deployment -f -
----
====

*Canceling a Deployment*

Cancelation can be very useful. You might want to cancel a deployment if:

* A deployment was initiated incorrectly, and you want to cancel it before it can do further damage.
* There is a security fix you need to apply, and you do not want to wait for an ongoing deployment to complete.
* A deployment or hook implementation is stuck after running for too long, and you cannot initiate a deployment when there is a deployment already running.

[NOTE]
====
By default, the deployment process is restricted to 6 hours. If a deployment is still in progress after 6 hours, then the containers for the deployment pod and any deployment hook pods are all deleted, and these pods are placed in the Failed state.
====

Cancel a running or stuck deployment with the following command:

----
$ oc deploy <config_name> --cancel
----

After running this command, the deployment eventually shuts down and transitions to a Failed status.
