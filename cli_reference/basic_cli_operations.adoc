== Overview
This topic provides information on the CLI operations and their syntax. You must
link:get_started_cli.html[setup and login] with the CLI before you can perform
these operations.

[[common-operations]]

== Common Operations
The CLI allows interaction with the various objects that are managed by
OpenShift. Many common `oc` operations are invoked using the following syntax:

----
$ oc <action> <object_type> <object_name_or_id>
----

This specifies:

- An `_<action>_` to perform, such as `get` or `describe`.
- The `_<object_type>_` to perform the action on, such as `service` or the abbreviated `svc`.
- The `_<object_name_or_id>_` of the specified `_<object_type>_`.

For example, the `oc get` operation returns a complete list of services that
are currently defined:

====

[options="nowrap"]
----
$ oc get svc
NAME              LABELS                                    SELECTOR                  IP              PORT(S)
docker-registry   docker-registry=default                   docker-registry=default   172.30.78.158   5000/TCP
kubernetes        component=apiserver,provider=kubernetes   <none>                    172.30.0.2      443/TCP
kubernetes-ro     component=apiserver,provider=kubernetes   <none>                    172.30.0.1      80/TCP
----
====

The `oc describe` operation can then be used to return detailed information
about a specific object:

====

[options="nowrap"]
----
$ oc describe svc docker-registry
Name:			docker-registry
Labels:			docker-registry=default
Selector:		docker-registry=default
IP:			172.30.78.158
Port:			<unnamed>	5000/TCP
Endpoints:		10.1.0.2:5000
Session Affinity:	None
No events.
----
====

[WARNING]
====
Versions of `oc` prior to
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
1.0.5
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
3.0.2.0
endif::[]
did not have the ability to negotiate API versions against a server. So if you are using `oc` up to
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
1.0.4
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
3.0.1.0
endif::[]
with a server that only supports v1 or higher versions of the API, make sure to pass `--api-version` in order to
point the `oc` client to the correct API endpoint. For example: `oc get svc --api-version=v1`.

|===

|Operation |Syntax |Description

|`get`
|`oc get <object_type> [<object_name_or_id>]`
|Return a list of objects for the specified link:#object-types[object type]. If
the optional `_<object_name_or_id>_` is included in the request, then the list
of results is filtered by that value.

|`describe`
|`oc describe <object_type> <object_id>`
|Returns information about the specific object returned by the query. A specific
`_<object_name_or_id>_` must be provided. The actual information that is
available varies as described in link:#object-types[object type].

.3+|`edit`
|`oc edit <object_type>/<object_type_name>`
|Edit the desired object type.

|`OC_EDITOR="<text_editor>" oc edit \`
`<object_type>/<object_type_name>`
|Edit the desired object type with a specified text editor.

|`oc edit <object_type>/<object_type_name> \`
`--output-version=<object_type_version> \`
`-o <object_type_format>`
|Edit the desired object in a specified format (eg: JSON).

|`env`
|`oc env <object_type>/<object_type_name> \`
`<var_name>=<value>`

|`label`
|`oc label <object_type> <object_name_or_id> \`
`<label>`
|Update the labels on a object.

|`expose`
|`oc expose <object_type> <object_name_or_id>`
|Look up a service and expose it as a route. There is also the ability to
expose a deployment configuration, replication controller, service, or pod as a
new service on a specified port. If no labels are specified, the new object will
re-use the labels from the object it exposes.

|`delete`
a|`oc delete -f <file_path>`

`oc delete <object_type> <object_name_or_id>`

`oc delete <object_type> -l <label>`

`oc delete all -l <label>`
.^|Delete the specified object. An object configuration can also be passed in
through STDIN. The `oc delete all -l <label>` operation deletes all objects
matching the specified `<label>`, including the
link:../architecture/core_concepts/deployments.html#replication-controllers[replication
controller] so that pods are not re-created.

[[build-and-deployment-cli-operations]]

== Build and Deployment CLI Operations
One of the fundamental capabilities of OpenShift is the ability to build
applications into a container from source. The following table describes the CLI
operations for working with application builds:

OpenShift provides CLI access to inspect and manipulate
link:../dev_guide/deployments.html[deployment configurations] using standard
`oc` resource operations, such as `get`, `create`, and `describe`.

[IMPORTANT]
====
link:https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2015:1650[For security purposes], the

administrators can SSH into a node host, then use the `docker exec`
command on the desired container.
