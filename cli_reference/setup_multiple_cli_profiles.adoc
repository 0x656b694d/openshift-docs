== Overview
The .kubeconfig file allows you to configure different profiles for the CLI, and easily switch between multiple clusters. This file contains a series of authentication mechanisms and cluster connection information associated with nicknames. It also introduces the concept of a tuple of user authentication and cluster connection information called a "context", which is also associated with a nickname. A tuple is a data structure consisting of multiple parts.

Multiple .kubeconfig files are allowed; they are loaded at runtime and merged together along with override options specified from the command line; see the loading and merging rules.

== Configuring .kubeconfig Files
In order to more easily configure .kubeconfig files, there are a series of helpful subcommands for `openshift ex config`.

.kubeconfig Operations
[cols=".^2,.^5,8",options="header"]
|===

|Operation |Syntax |Description

|`openshift ex config set-credentials`
|`openshift ex config set-credentials <name> --auth-path=<path_to_authfile> --client-certificate=<path_to_cert> --client-key=<path_to_key> --token=<string>`
|Sets a user entry in .kubeconfig. If the referenced name already exists, the specified information will be merged in.

|`openshift ex config set-cluster`
|`openshift ex config set-cluster <name> --server=<server> --skip-tls=<bool> --certificate-authority=<path_to_CA> --api-version=<string>`
|Sets a cluster entry in .kubeconfig. If the referenced name already exists, the specified information will be merged in.

|`openshift ex config set-context`
|`openshift ex config set-context <name> --user=<string> --cluster=<string> --namespace=<string>`
|Sets a config entry in .kubeconfig. If the referenced name already exists, the specified information will be merged in.

|`openshift ex config use-context`
|`openshift ex config use-context <name>`
|Sets current-context to the specified name.

|`openshift ex config set`
|`openshift ex config set <property-name> <property-value>`
|Sets arbitrary value in the .kubeconfig file.

|`openshift ex config unset`
|`openshift ex config unset <property-name>`
|Unsets arbitrary value in the .kubeconfig file.

|`openshift ex config view`
|`openshift ex config view --config=<specific_filename>`
|Displays the result of the specified .kubeconfig file.

.Example Kubeconfig Operation
====

----
$openshift ex config set-credentials myself --auth-path=path/to/my/existing/auth-file
$openshift ex config set-cluster local-server --server=http://localhost:8080
$openshift ex config set-context default-context --cluster=local-server --user=myself
$openshift ex config use-context default-context
$openshift ex config set contexts.default-context.namespace the-right-prefix
$openshift ex config view
----
====

This example produces the following output:
```
clusters:
  local-server:
    server: http://localhost:8080
contexts:
  default-context:
    cluster: local-server
    namespace: the-right-prefix
    user: myself
current-context: default-context
preferences: {}
users:
  myself:
    auth-path: path/to/my/existing/auth-file

```
This example produces the following .kubeconfig file:
```
apiVersion: v1
clusters:
- cluster:
    server: http://localhost:8080
  name: local-server
contexts:
- context:
    cluster: local-server
    namespace: the-right-prefix
    user: myself
  name: default-context
current-context: default-context
kind: Config
preferences: {}
users:
- name: myself
  user:
    auth-path: path/to/my/existing/auth-file
```
== Loading and merging rules
The loading order follows these rules:
    1. If the --config flag is set, then only that file is loaded.  The flag may only be set once and no merging takes place.
    2. If $OPENSHIFTCONFIG environment variable is set, then it is used a list of paths (normal path delimitting rules for your system).  These paths are merged together.  When a value is modified, it is modified in the file that defines the stanza.  When a value is created, it is created in the first file that exists.  If no files in the chain exist, then it creates the last file in the list.
    3. Otherwise, ${HOME}/.config/openshift/config is used and no merging takes place.

. Determine the context to use based on the first hit in this chain:
** Command line argument - the value of the `context` command line option.
** Current-context from the kubeconfig file.
** Empty is allowed at this stage.
. Determine the user and cluster information to use. At this point, you may or may not have a context; they are built based on the first hit in this chain. Hint: Run it twice, once for user, once for cluster.
** Command line argument: `user` for user name and `cluster` for cluster name
** If context is present, then use the context's value.
** Empty is allowed at this stage.
. Determine the actual cluster info to use. At this point, you may or may not have a cluster info. Build each piece of the cluster info based on the chain (first hit wins):
** Command line arguments: `server`, `api-version`, `certificate-authority`, and `insecure-skip-tls-verify`.
** If cluster info and a value for the attribute is present, then use it.
** If you don't have a server location, then there is an error.
. Users are built using the same rules as cluster info, except that you can only have one authentication technique per user. The command line flags are: `auth-path`, `client-certificate`, `client-key`, and `token`. If there are two conflicting techniques, then this fails.
. If you are missing information or are unsure, use the default values and follow prompts for authentication information.
