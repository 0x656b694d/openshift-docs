== Basic Setup and Login
The `osc login` command is the best way to initially set up the OpenShift CLI,
and it serves as the entry point for most users. The interactive flow helps you
establish a session to an OpenShift server with the provided credentials. The
information is automatically saved in a link:#cli-configuration-files[CLI
configuration file] that is then used for subsequent commands.

The following example shows the interactive setup and login using the `osc
login` command:

.Initial CLI Setup
====

[options="nowrap"]
----
$ osc login
OpenShift server [https://localhost:8443]: https://openshift.example.com <1>

Username: alice <2>
Authentication required for https://openshift.example.com (openshift)
Password: ******
Login successful. <3>

You don't have any projects. You can try to create a new project, by running

    $ osc new-project <projectname> <4>

Welcome to OpenShift! See 'osc help' to get started.
----

<1> The command prompts for the OpenShift server URL.
<2> The command prompts for login credentials: a user name and password.
<3> A session is established with the server, and a session token is received.
<4> If you do not have a project, information is given on how to create one.
====

When you have completed the CLI configuration, subsequent commands use the
configuration file for the server, session token, and project information.

You can log out of CLI using the `osc logout` command:

====

[options="nowrap"]
----
$ osc logout
User, alice, logged out of https://openshift.example.com
----
====

If you log in after creating or being granted access to a project, a project you
have access to is automatically set as the current default, until
link:#projects[switching to another one]:

====

[options="nowrap"]
----
$ osc login
Username: alice
Authentication required for https://openshift.example.com (openshift)
Password:
Login successful.

Using project "aliceproject".
----
====

link:../dev_guide/authentication.html[Additional options] are also available for
the `osc login` command.

== CLI Configuration Files

A CLI configuration file permanently stores `osc` options and contains a series
of link:#../architecture/additional_concepts/authentication.html[authentication]
mechanisms and OpenShift server connection information associated with
nicknames.

As described in the previous section, the `osc login` command automatically
creates and manages CLI configuration files. All information gathered by the
command is stored in a configuration file located in
*_~/.config/openshift/.config_*. The current CLI configuration can be viewed using the following command:

.Viewing the CLI Configuration
====

[options="nowrap"]
----
$ osc config view
apiVersion: v1
clusters:
- cluster:
    server: https://openshift.example.com
  name: openshift
contexts:
- context:
    cluster: openshift
    namespace: aliceproject
    user: alice
  name: alice
current-context: alice
kind: Config
preferences: {}
users:
- name: alice
  user:
    token: NDM2N2MwODgtNjI1Yy10N3VhLTg1YmItYzI4NDEzZDUyYzVi
----
====

CLI configuration files can be used to link:manage_cli_profiles.html[setup
multiple CLI profiles] using various OpenShift servers, namespaces, and users so
that you can switch easily between them. The CLI can support multiple
configuration files; they are loaded at runtime and merged together along with
any override options specified from the command line.

== Projects
A link:../dev_guide/projects.html[project] in OpenShift contains multiple
link:../architecture/core_objects/openshift_model.html[components] to make up a
logical "link:../whats_new/applications.html[application]".

Most `osc` commands run in the context of a
link:../dev_guide/projects.html[project]. The `osc login` selects a default
project during link:#basic-setup-and-login[initial setup] to be used with
subsequent commands. Use the following command to display the project currently
in use:

----
$ osc project
----

If you have access to multiple projects, use the following syntax to switch to a
particular project by specifying the project name:

----
$ osc project <project_name>
----

For example:

====

----
$ osc project project02
Now using project 'project02'.

$ osc project project03
Now using project 'project03'.

$ osc project
Using project 'project03'.
----
====

The `osc status` command shows a high level overview of the project currently in
use, with its components and their relationships, as shown in the following
example:

====

[options="nowrap"]
----
$ osc status
In project OpenShift 3 Sample (test)

service database-test (172.30.17.113:6434 -> 3306)
  database-test deploys docker.io/library/mysql:latest
    #1 deployed 47 hours ago

service frontend-test (172.30.17.236:5432 -> 8080)
  frontend-test deploys origin-ruby-sample:test <-
    builds git://github.com/openshift/ruby-hello-world.git with docker.io/openshift/ruby-20-centos7:latest
    not built yet
    #1 deployment waiting on image

To see more information about a service or deployment config, use 'osc describe service <name>' or 'osc describe dc <name>'.
You can use 'osc get pods,svc,dc,bc,builds' to see lists of each of the types described above.

After you have link:get_started_cli.html#basic-setup-and-login[logged in], you
can link:../dev_guide/new_app.html[create a new application] and explore some
common link:basic_cli_operations.html[CLI operations].
