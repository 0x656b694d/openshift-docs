== Basic Setup and Login
The `osc login` command is the best way to set up and configure the OpenShift CLI,
and it serves as the entry point for most users. The interactive flow helps you
establish a session to an OpenShift server with the provided credentials. The
configuration is automatically saved and is then used for every subsequent
command.

The following example shows the interactive setup and login using the `osc login` command:

.CLI Setup and Login
====

[options="nowrap"]
----
$ osc login
Please provide the server URL or just <enter> to use 'https://my-openshift-server.com': <1>
Authenticate for "openshift"
Username: myuser <2>
Password: ******
Logged into 'https://my-openshift-server.com' as 'myuser'. <3>
Using project 'project01'. <4>
Welcome to OpenShift v3! Use 'osc --help' for a list of commands available.
----

<1> The command prompts for the OpenShift server URL.
<2> The command prompts for login credentials: a user name and password.
<3> A session is established with the server, and a session token is received.
<4> One OpenShift project the user has access to is selected and set as the default.
====

When you have completed the CLI configuration, every subsequent command uses the
configuration file for the server, session token, and project information.

The following example shows the output of the `osc login` command after the CLI
has been configured:

====

[options="nowrap"]
----
$ osc login
Already logged into 'https://my-openshift-server.com' as 'myuser'.
Using project 'project01'.
----
====

link:../dev_guide/authentication.html[Additional options] are also available for
the `osc login` command.

== CLI Configuration Files

A CLI configuration file permanently stores `osc` options and contains a series of
authentication mechanisms and server connection information associated with
nicknames.

As described in the previous section, the `osc login` command automatically
creates and manages CLI configuration files. All information gathered by the
command is stored in a configuration file located in
*_~/.config/openshift/.config_*., as seen in the following example:

.CLI Configuration File
====

[options="nowrap"]
----
apiVersion: v1
clusters:
- cluster:
    server: https://my-openshift-server.com
  name: myserver
contexts:
- context:
    cluster: myserver
    namespace: project01
    user: myuser
  name: mycontext
current-context: mycontext
kind: Config
preferences: {}
users:
- name: myuser
  user:
    token: NmUyM2M4YjQtZDc2ZC00MDFiLWIxZGEtMjY4N2RlZmJlODE2

CLI configuration files can be used to
link:setup_multiple_cli_profiles.html[setup multiple OpenShift servers,
namespaces, and users] for the CLI so that you can switch easily between
contexts. Multiple configuration files are allowed; they are loaded at runtime
and merged together along with any override options specified from the command
line.

There are multiple methods that you can use to create a configuration file to be
used with the CLI. The following rules are observed in order when loading CLI
configuration, if the following files exist or options are specified:

.  The path provided by the `--config` command line option.
.  The path provided by the `*$OPENSHIFTCONFIG*` environment variable.
.  The *_.openshiftconfig_* file in the current directory.
.  The *_.config_* file inside the *_.config/openshift_* directory in the user's home: *_~/.config/openshift/.config_*.
.  The path provided by the `*$KUBECONFIG*` environment variable.
.  The *_.kubeconfig_* file in the current directory.
.  The *_.kubeconfig_* file inside the *_.kube_* directory in the user's home: `~/.kube/.kubeconfig`

You can easily link:setup_multiple_cli_profiles.html[configure and manage multiple CLI
profiles] using the `osc config` command.

== Projects
A link:../dev_guide/projects.html[project] in OpenShift is the package that
contains multiple
link:../architecture/core_objects/openshift_model.html[components] to make up a
logical "link:../whats_new/applications.html[application]".

Most `osc` commands run in the context of a
link:../dev_guide/projects.html[project]. The `osc login` selects a default
project during link:#basic-setup-and-login[initial setup] to be used with
subsequent commands. Use the following command to display the project currently
in use:
****
`$ osc project`
****

If you have access to multiple projects, use the following syntax to switch to a particular project by specifying the project name:

****
`$ osc project _<project_name>_`
****

For example:

====

----
$ osc project project02
Now using project 'project02'.

$ osc project project03
Now using project 'project03'.

$ osc project
Using project 'project03'.
----
====

The `osc status` command shows a high level overview of the project currently in
use, with its components and their relationships, as shown in the following
example:

====

[options="nowrap"]
----
$ osc status
In project OpenShift 3 Sample (test)

service database-test (172.30.17.113:6434 -> 3306)
  database-test deploys docker.io/library/mysql:latest
    #1 deployed 47 hours ago

service frontend-test (172.30.17.236:5432 -> 8080)
  frontend-test deploys origin-ruby-sample:test <-
    builds git://github.com/openshift/ruby-hello-world.git with docker.io/openshift/ruby-20-centos7:latest
    not built yet
    #1 deployment waiting on image

To see more information about a service or deployment config, use 'osc describe service <name>' or 'osc describe dc <name>'.
You can use 'osc get pods,svc,dc,bc,builds' to see lists of each of the types described above.
