== Basic Setup and Login
The recommended way to setup the OpenShift CLI is using the `osc login` command. This command can be considered *the entry-point for every first-time OpenShift CLI user*. It features an *interactive flow* that will guide the user through establishing a session against an OpenShift server with the provided credentials, and will *automatically save* a config file that will be used by every subsequent command. 

Here is an example of how an `osc login` run looks like:

----
$ osc login
Please provide the server URL or just <enter> to use 'https://my-openshift-server.com': 
Authenticate for "openshift"
Username: myuser
Password: ******
Logged into 'https://my-openshift-server.com' as 'myuser'.
Using project 'project01'.
Welcome to OpenShift v3! Use 'osc --help' for a list of commands available.
----

Three major things happened in the above command run:

* `osc login` asked for the OpenShift server URL and the user's credentials (_username_ and _password_), established a session in the server, and received a session token.
* One OpenShift project the user has access to was selected and set as default.
* All information gathered were saved in a config file located in `~/.config/openshift/.config`.

Here's how the content of the config file just created in `~/.config/openshift/.config` looks like:

----
apiVersion: v1
clusters:
- cluster:
    server: https://my-openshift-server.com
  name: myserver
contexts:
- context:
    cluster: myserver
    namespace: project01
    user: myuser
  name: mycontext
current-context: mycontext
kind: Config
preferences: {}
users:
- name: myuser
  user:
    token: NmUyM2M4YjQtZDc2ZC00MDFiLWIxZGEtMjY4N2RlZmJlODE2
---- 

From now on, every subsequent command will make use of the server, session token and project referenced in that config file. Notice what happens if you run `osc login` again:

----
$ osc login
Already logged into 'https://my-openshift-server.com' as 'myuser'.
Using project 'project01'.
----

== Configuration Files

Configuration file permanently stores `osc` options; it contains a series of authentication mechanisms and server connection information associated with nicknames. As described in the previous section, the `osc login` command is capable of creating and managing configuration files automatically.

.Sample configuration file:
====

----
apiVersion: v1
clusters:
- cluster:
    server: http://localhost:8080
  name: my-server
contexts:
- context:
    cluster: my-server
    namespace: my-namespace
    user: my-user
  name: default-context
current-context: default-context
kind: Config
preferences: {}
users:
- name: my-user
  user:
    auth-path: path/to/my/existing/auth-file
----
====

Configuration files can be used for example to configure OpenShift to support the setup of multiple servers, namespaces, and users so that you can switch easily between them. Multiple configuration files are allowed; they are loaded at runtime and merged together along with override options specified from the command line. 

There are a few ways to provide `osc` a configuration file. Basically when loading configurations the following priority rules for configuration file loading are observed (in this exact order):

.  The path provided by the `--config` command line option
.  The path provided by the `$OPENSHIFTCONFIG` environment variable
.  The `.openshiftconfig` file in the current directory
.  The `.config` file inside the `.config/openshift` directory in the user's home: `~/.config/openshift/.config`
.  The path provided by the `$KUBECONFIG` environment variable
.  The `.kubeconfig` file in the current directory
.  The `.kubeconfig` file inside the `.kube` directory in the user's home: `~/.kube/.kubeconfig`

For details about advanced management of config files, see link:../using_openshift/managing_cli_profiles.html[Managing CLI Profiles].

== Projects
A link:../architecture/openshift_model.html#project-experimental[project] in OpenShift terms is the package that can contain multiple link:../architecture/openshift_model.html[components] that will compose your logical "link:../v2_changes/applications.html[application]". 

That said, most `osc` commands that will be described in the sections below run in the context of a _project_. When running `osc login` a project will be set as default to be used by every subsequent command, and if the user has access to more than one project, one of them will be picked:

----
$ osc login --server=https://localhost:8443 --certificate-authority=cert.crt
Authenticate for "openshift"
Username: myuser
Password: ******
Logged into 'https://localhost:8443' as 'myuser'.
Your projects are: project01, project02, project03. You can switch between them at any time using 'osc project <project-name>'.
Using project 'project01'.
Welcome to OpenShift v3! Use 'osc --help' for a list of commands available.
----

To switch between the projects an user has access to, the `osc project` command is provided. It can be used as `osc project <project-name>` to switch to an explicit project, or just as `osc project` to display the project currently in use.

----
$ osc project project02
Now using project 'project02'.

$ osc project project03
Now using project 'project03'.

$ osc project
Using project 'project03'.
----

The same way `git status` provides a general overview of the working tree of a local git repository, we provide a command that shows a high level overview of the project currently in use, with its components and their relationships. This command takes no argument. Sample output of the `osc status` command:

----
$ osc status
In project OpenShift 3 Sample (test)

service database-test (172.30.17.113:6434 -> 3306)
  database-test deploys docker.io/library/mysql:latest
    #1 deployed 47 hours ago

service frontend-test (172.30.17.236:5432 -> 8080)
  frontend-test deploys origin-ruby-sample:test <-
    builds git://github.com/openshift/ruby-hello-world.git with docker.io/openshift/ruby-20-centos7:latest
    not built yet
    #1 deployment waiting on image

To see more information about a service or deployment config, use 'osc describe service <name>' or 'osc describe dc <name>'.
You can use 'osc get pods,svc,dc,bc,builds' to see lists of each of the types described above.

== CLI Object Types
OpenShift supports the following object types, some of which have abbreviated syntax that you can use with `osc`.
