You can configure OpenShift to support the setup of multiple servers, namespaces, and users so that you can switch easily between them. The `.kubeconfig` configuration file permanently stores `osc` options; it contains a series of authentication mechanisms and server connection information associated with nicknames.

.Sample `.kubeconfig` Configuration File:
====

----
apiVersion: v1
clusters:
- cluster:
    server: http://localhost:8080
  name: my-server
contexts:
- context:
    cluster: my-server
    namespace: my-namespace
    user: my-user
  name: default-context
current-context: default-context
kind: Config
preferences: {}
users:
- name: my-user
  user:
    auth-path: path/to/my/existing/auth-file
----
====

Multiple `.kubeconfig` files are allowed; they are loaded at runtime and merged together along with override options specified from the command line. The priority rules for configuration file loading are:

.  The path provided by the `kubeconfig` command line option
.  The path provided by the `$KUBECONFIG` environment variable
.  The `.kubeconfig` file in the current directory
.  The `.kubeconfig` file inside the `.kube` directory in the user's home: `~/.kube/.kubeconfig`

For more details about `.kubeconfig` files, see link:../using_openshift/managing_cli_profiles.html[Managing CLI Profiles].

The .kubeconfig file allows you to configure different profiles for the CLI, and easily switch between multiple clusters. This file contains a series of authentication mechanisms and cluster connection information associated with nicknames. It also introduces the concept of a tuple of user authentication and cluster connection information called a "context", which is also associated with a nickname. A tuple is a data structure consisting of multiple parts.
