== Overview
Defining image metadata helps OpenShift better consume your Docker images, allowing OpenShift to create a better experience for developers using your image. For example, you can add metadata to provide helpful descriptions of your image, or offer suggestions on other images that may also be needed.

NOTE: Currently, you can only define metadata for Docker images by specifying extra environment variables. There is upstream work currently being done to fix this situation which will be implemented in a later release.

This topic only defines the metadata needed by the current set of use cases. Additional metadata or use cases may be added in the future.

== Defining Image Metadata
You can use the `ENV` instruction in a [filename]#Dockerfile# to define image metadata. This instruction is used to define environment variables that are available inside the container, allowing the application running in the container to consume them. See the  https://docs.docker.com/reference/builder/#env[Docker documentation] for more information on the `ENV` instruction.

The environment variables are also available in the Docker image JSON
representation, where the platform can see them and use them.

|===

|Variable |Description

|[envar]#IMAGE_TAGS#
|Specifies a list of tags for categorizing Docker images into broad areas of functionality. Tags help the UI and generation tools suggest relevant images during the application creation process. Example format:

****
[envar]#IMAGE_TAGS#=[replaceable]#database,mysql#
****

|[envar]#IMAGE_WANTS#
|Specifies a list of tags that the UI and generation tools might suggest to provide if you do not have the Docker images with given tags already. For example, if the image wants `mysql` and `redis`, and you do not have an image with a `redis` tag, then the UI might suggest you to add this image into your application. Example format:

****
[envar]#IMAGE_WANTS#=[replaceable]#mysql,redis#
****

|[envar]#IMAGE_DESCRIPTION#
|Gives image consumers a more detailed description about the service or functionality provided by the image. The UI can use this description together with the image name to give users more information about the image. Example format:

****
[envar]#IMAGE_DESCRIPTION#="[replaceable]#MySQL 5.5 database#"
****

|[envar]#IMAGE_EXPOSE_SERVICES#
|Contains a list of ports that match with the `EXPOSE` instructions in the [filename]#Dockerfile# and provides more descriptive information about what actual service the given port provides.

The format is `PORT[/PROTO]:SERVICE_NAME` where `[PROTO]` is optional and defaults to `tcp` if unspecified. Example format:

****
[envar]#IMAGE_EXPOSE_SERVICES#="[replaceable]#3128/tcp:mysql,8080:http#"
****

|[envar]#IMAGE_NON_SCALABLE#
|Used to suggest to consumers through the UI that the image does not support scaling. Being non-scalable basically means that the value of `replicas` should initially not be set higher than `1`. Example format:

****
[envar]#IMAGE_NON_SCALABLE#=[replaceable]#true#
****

|[envar]#IMAGE_MIN_CPU# and [envar]#IMAGE_MIN_MEMORY#
|Specify the amount resources the image requires to work properly. The UI might warn the user that deploying this image may exceed the user quota. The values must be compatible with https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes/blob/master/docs/resources.md#resource-quantities[Kubernetes quantity] values for CPU and memory. Example format:

****
[envar]#IMAGE_MIN_CPU#=[replaceable]#8Gi#

[envar]#IMAGE_MIN_MEMORY#=[replaceable]#4#
****
