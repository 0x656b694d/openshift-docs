== Overview
Defining image metadata helps OpenShift better consume your Docker images,
allowing OpenShift to create a better experience for developers using your
image. For example, you can add metadata to provide helpful descriptions of your
image, or offer suggestions on other images that may also be needed.

This topic only defines the metadata needed by the current set of use cases.
Additional metadata or use cases may be added in the future.

== Defining Image Metadata
You can use the `LABEL` instruction in a *_Dockerfile_* to define image
metadata. Labels are similar to environment variables in that they are key value
pairs attached to an image or a container. Labels are different from environment
variable in that they are not visible to the running application and they can
also be used for fast look-up of images and containers.

https://docs.docker.com/reference/builder/#label[Docker documentation] for more
information on the `LABEL` instruction.

The label names should typically be namespaced. The namespace should be set
accordingly to reflect the project that is going to pick up the labels and use
them. For OpenShift the namespace should be set to *_openshift.io/_* and for
Kubernetes the namespace is *_k8s.io/_*. For simple labels, like `displayName`
or `description` there might be no namespace set if they end up as standard in
Docker.

|===

|Variable |Description

|`*openshift.io/tags*`
|This label contains a list of tags represented as list of comma separated
string values. The tags are the way to categorize the Docker images into broad
areas of functionality. Tags help UI and generation tools to suggest relevant
Docker images during the application creation process.

====

----
LABEL openshift.io/tags   mongodb,mongodb24,nosql
----
====

|`*openshift.io/wants*`
|Specifies a list of tags that the generation tools and the UI might use to
provide relevant suggestions if you don't have the Docker images with given tags
already. For example, if the Docker image wants `mysql` and `redis` and you
don't have the Docker image with `redis` tag, then UI might suggest you to add
this image into your deployment.

====

----
LABEL openshift.io/wants   mongodb,redis
----
====

|`*k8s.io/description*`
|This label can be used to give the Docker image consumers more detailed
information about the service or functionality this image provides. The UI can
then use this description together with the Docker image name to provide more
human friendly information to end users.

====

----
LABEL k8s.io/description The MySQL 5.5 Server with master-slave replication support
----
====

|`*openshift.io/expose-services*`
|This label contains a list of service ports that match with the `EXPOSE`
instructions in the _*Dockerfile*_ and provide more descriptive information about
what actual service on the given port provides to consumers.

The format is `PORT[/PROTO]:NAME` where the `[PROTO]` part is optional and it
defaults to `tcp` if it is not specified.

====

----
LABEL openshift.io/expose-services 2020/udp:ftp,8080:https
----
====

|`*openshift.io/non-scalable*`
|An image might use this variable to suggest that it does not support scaling.
The UI will then communicate this to consumers of that image. Being not-scalable
basically means that the value of `replicas` should initially not be set higher
than 1.

====

----
LABEL openshift.io/non-scalable     true
----
====

|`*openshift.io/min-memory*` and `*openshift.io/min-cpu*`
|This label suggests how much resources the Docker image might need in order to
work properly. The UI might warn the user that deploying this Docker image may
exceed their user quota.  The values must be compatible with
https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes/blob/master/docs/resources.md#resource-quantities[Kubernetes
quantity].

====

----
LABEL openshift.io/min-memory 8Gi
LABEL openshift.io/min-cpu     4
