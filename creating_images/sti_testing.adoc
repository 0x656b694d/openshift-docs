== Overview
As an Source-to-Image (S2I) builder image author, you can test your S2I image
locally and use the OpenShift build system for automated testing and continuous
integration.

[NOTE]
====
Check the link:sti.html[S2I Requirements] topic to learn more about the S2I
architecture before proceeding.
====

As described in the link:sti.html[S2I Requirements] topic, S2I requires the
*_assemble_* and *_run_* scripts to be present in order to successfully execute
the S2I build. Providing the *_save-artifacts_* script reuses the build
artifacts, and providing the *_usage_* script ensures that usage information is
printed to console when someone runs the Docker image outside of the S2I.

The goal of testing an S2I image is to make sure that all of these described
commands work properly, even if the base Docker image has changed or the tooling
used by the commands was updated.

== Testing Requirements
The standard location for the *_test_* script is *_test/run_*. This script is
invoked by the OpenShift S2I image builder and it could be a simple Bash script
or a static Go binary.

The *_test/run_* script performs the S2I build, so you must have the S2I binary
available on your system. If required, follow the installation instructions in
the S2I
https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image/blob/master/README.md#installation[README].

S2I combines the application source code and Docker image, so in order to test
it you need a sample application source to verify that the source successfully
converts into a Docker image. The sample application should be simple, but it
should also exercise the `assemble` command.

== Generating Scripts and Tools
The S2I tooling comes with powerful generation tools to speed up the process of
creating a new S2I image. The `sti create` command produces all necessary S2I
scripts and testing tools along with the *_Makefile_*:
****
`$ sti create _<image name>_ _<destination directory>_`
****

The generated *_test/run_* script must be adjusted to be
useful, but it provides a good starting point to begin developing.

[NOTE]
====
The *_test/run_* script produced by the `sti create` command requires that the sample application sources are inside the *_test/test-app_* directory.
====

== Testing Locally
The easiest way to run the S2I image tests locally is to use the generated
*_Makefile_*. If you did not use the `sti create` command, you can copy the
following *_Makefile_* template and replace the `*IMAGE_NAME*` parameter with
your image name.

.Sample *_Makefile_*
====

----
IMAGE_NAME = openshift/ruby-20-centos7

build:
	docker build -t $(IMAGE_NAME) .

.PHONY: test
test:
	docker build -t $(IMAGE_NAME)-candidate .
	IMAGE_NAME=$(IMAGE_NAME)-candidate test/run
----
====

== Basic Testing Workflow
The *_test_* script assumes you have already built the image that you want to
test. If required, first build the S2I image using:

****
`$ docker build -t _<BUILDER_IMAGE_NAME>_`
****

The following steps describe the default workflow to test S2I image builders:

. Verify the *_usage_* script is working:
+
====

****
`$ docker run _<BUILDER_IMAGE_NAME>_`
****
====

. Build the image:
+
====

[options="nowrap"]
****
`$ sti build file:///path-to-sample-app _<BUILDER_IMAGE_NAME>_ _<OUTPUT_APPLICATION_IMAGE_NAME>_`
****
====

. If you support *_save-artifacts_*, then execute step 2 again to verify that restoring artifacts works properly.

. Run the container:
+
====

****
`$ docker run _<OUTPUT_APPLICATION_IMAGE_NAME>_`
****
====

. Verify the container is running and the application is responding.

Executing these steps is generally enough to tell if the S2I scripts are
operating properly.

== Using OpenShift Build for Automated Testing
Another way you can execute the S2I image tests is to use the OpenShift platform
itself as a continuous integration system. The OpenShift platform is capable of
building Docker images and is highly customizable.

To set up an S2I image builder continuous integration system, define a special `*CustomBuild*` and use the
*openshift/sti-image-builder* image. This image executes all the steps mentioned
in the link:#basic-testing-workflow[Basic Testing Workflow] section and creates
a new S2I builder image.

  }
}

====

You can use the `oc create` command to create this `*BuildConfig*`. After you create the `*BuildConfig*`, you can start the build using the following command:

====

****
`$ oc start-build ruby-20-centos7-build`
****
====

If your OpenShift instance is hosted on a public IP address, then the build is
triggered each time you push into your S2I builder image GitHub repository.

You can also use the `*CustomBuild*` to trigger a rebuild for your applications
based on the S2I image you updated. To do this you must specify the `Output`
field in the `parameters` section and define to which Docker registry the image
should be pushed after a successful build.
