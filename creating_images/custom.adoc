== Overview
link:../architecture/core_objects/builds.html#custom-build[Custom build] is designed
to fill the gap that was created when everybody jumped into creating docker images.
Still there is a requirement to produce packages with all the software being installed
and most importantly one needs to be able to build base docker images. This is
where Custom build is the perfect match to fill in that gap.

To fully utilize the power of Custom build one needs to be understand how to
create a builder image that will be capable of building desired objects.

== Custom builder image
The builder image upon invocation receives following environment variables with
the information needed to proceed with the build:
