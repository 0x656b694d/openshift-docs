== Overview
Our OpenShift https://github.com/openshift/sti-perl/tree/master/5.16[Perl]
image repository contains the sources and Dockerfiles for building various 
versions of Perl platform images. The resulting images can be run either by 
Docker or using https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image[STI].

== Versions
Currently, OpenShift only supports version https://github.com/openshift/sti-perl/tree/master/5.16[5.16] of Perl.

== Base Images

* RHEL 7
* CentOS 7

[NOTE]
====
In order to perform build or test action on a RHEL 7 based Perl image, you 
need to run the build on properly subscribed RHEL 7 machine.
====

== Installation
To build a Perl image, choose between a RHEL 7 or CentOS 7 base image:

=== RHEL 7 base image

----
$ git clone https://github.com/openshift/sti-perl.git
$ cd sti-perl
$ make build TARGET=rhel7 VERSION=5.16
----

=== CentOS 7 Base Image

----
$ git clone https://github.com/openshift/sti-perl.git
$ cd sti-perl
$ make build VERSION=5.16
----

[NOTE]
====
If you omit the `VERSION` parameter, the build/test action is performed on all 
supported versions of Perl. Since version `5.16` is the only version supported, 
you can omit this parameter.
====

== Usage
To build a simple https://github.com/openshift/sti-perl/tree/master/5.16/test/sample-test-app[perl-sample-app]
Perl application, use a standalone https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image[STI]
and run the resulting image using http://docker.io[Docker].

=== RHEL 7 Base Image

----
$ sti build https://github.com/openshift/sti-perl.git --contextDir=/5.16/test/sample-test-app/ openshift/perl-516-rhel7 perl-sample-app
$ docker run -p 8080:8080 perl-sample-app
----

=== CentOS 7 Base Image

----
$ sti build https://github.com/openshift/sti-perl.git --contextDir=/5.16/test/sample-test-app/ openshift/perl-516-centos7 perl-sample-app
$ docker run -p 8080:8080 perl-sample-app
----

To access and test if the application is running:

----
$ curl 127.0.0.1:8080
----

== Test
The OpenShift https://github.com/openshift/sti-perl/tree/master/5.16[STI-Perl]
repository also provides the STI test framework, which tests the functionality
of a simple Perl application built on top of STI-Perl image.

=== RHEL7 Base Image

----
$ cd sti-perl
$ make test TARGET=rhel7 VERSION=5.16
----

=== CentOS 7 Base Image

----
$ cd sti-perl
$ make test VERSION=5.16
----

[NOTE]
====
If you omit the `VERSION` parameter, the build/test action is performed on all
supported versions of Perl. Since version `5.16` is the only version supported,
you can omit this parameter.

== Image Name Structure

Use the following image name structure:

****
`openshift/[replaceable]#<platform_name>#-[replaceable]#<platform_version>#-[replaceable]#<base_builder_image>#`
****

Where:

. [replaceable]#<platform_name># - Refers to the STI platform; for example, `perl`
. [replaceable]#<platform_version># - The version of the referenced platform, without dots; for example, `516` for Perl 5.16
. [replaceable]#<Base_builder_image># - The base OS, such as `rhel7` or `centos7`

.Example image names:
====

----
openshift/perl-516-centos7

openshift/perl-516-rhel7
----
====

== Environment Variables

To set these environment variables, you can place them into `.sti/environment`
file inside your source code repository.

* [envvar]#ENABLE_CPAN_TEST# - This variable will install all the cpan modules and run their tests. By default is the testing of the modules turned off. 

* [envvar]#CPAN_MIRROR# - This variable specifies mirror URL which will cpanminus use to install dependencies. By default the URL is not specified.
