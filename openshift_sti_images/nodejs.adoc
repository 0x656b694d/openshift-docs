== Overview
Our OpenShift https://github.com/openshift/sti-nodejs/tree/master/0.10[NodeJS] image repository contains the sources and Dockerfiles for building various versions of NodeJS platform images. The resulting images can be run either by Docker or using https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image[STI].

== Versions
Current supported versions of NodeJS:

* https://github.com/openshift/sti-nodejs/tree/master/0.10[0.10]

== Base Images

* RHEL-7
* CentOS-7

[NOTE]
====
RHEL-7 image is not available as trusted build in https://index.docker.io[Docker Index]. In order to perform build or test action on a RHEL-7 based NodaJS image, you need to run the build on properly subscribed RHEL-7 machine.
====

== Installation
To build NodeJS image, choose between CentOS7 or RHEL7 base image:

=== RHEL-7 base image

----
$ git clone https://github.com/openshift/sti-nodejs.git
$ cd sti-nodejs
$ make build TARGET=rhel7 VERSION=0.10
----

=== CentOS-7 base image

----
$ git clone https://github.com/openshift/sti-nodejs.git
$ cd sti-nodejs
$ make build VERSION=0.10
----

[NOTE]
====
By omitting the `VERSION` parameter, the build/test action will be performed on all the supported versions of NodeJS. Since we are now supporting only version `0.10`, you can omit this parameter
====

== Usage
Building simple https://github.com/ryanj/node-echo[nodejs-echo-app] NodeJS application, using standalone https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image[STI] and running the resulting image by http://docker.io[Docker]

=== RHEL-7 base image

----
$ sti build https://github.com/ryanj/node-echo.git openshift/nodejs-010-rhel7 nodejs-echo-app
$ docker run -p 3000:3000 nodejs-echo-app
----

=== CentOS-7 base image

----
$ sti build https://github.com/ryanj/node-echo.git openshift/nodejs-010-centos7 nodejs-echo-app
$ docker run -p 3000:3000 nodejs-echo-app
----

To access and test if the application is running run:
----
$ curl 127.0.0.1:3000
----

== Test
OpenShift https://github.com/openshift/sti-nodejs/tree/master/0.10[STI-NodeJS] repository also provides STI test framework, which launches test to check functionality of a simple nodejs application built on top of sti-nodejs image.

=== RHEL-7 base image

----
$ cd sti-nodejs
$ make test TARGET=rhel7 VERSION=0.10
----

=== CentOS-7 base image

----
$ cd sti-nodejs
$ make test VERSION=0.10
----

[NOTE]
====
By omitting the `VERSION` parameter, the build/test action will be performed on all the supported versions of NodeJS. Since we are now supporting only version `0.10`, you can omit this parameter

== Repository organization

* `/nodejs-version/`
** `Dockerfile` - CentOS7 based Dockerfile.
** `Dockerfile.rhel7` - RHEL7 based Dockerfile.
** `.sti/bin/` - This folder contains scripts that are run by https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image[STI]:
*** `assemble` - Is used to install the sources into location from where the application  will be run and prepare the application for deployment (eg. installing modules using npm, etc..).
*** `run` - This script is responsible for running the application, by using the application web server.
*** `save-artifacts` - In order to do an *incremental build* (iow. re-use the build artifacts from an already built image in a new image), this script is responsible for archiving those. In this image, this script will archive all dependent modules.
** `nodejs/` - This folder contains file with commonly used modules.
** `test/` - This folder is containing STI test framework with simple node.js echo server.
*** `test-app/` - Simple node.js echo server for used for testing purposes in the STI test framework.
*** `run` - Script that runs the STI test framework.
* `hack/` - Folder contains scripts which are responsible for build and test actions performed by the `Makefile`.
* `Makefile` - Make utility for simplifying image build and test actions.

== Environment variables

* *APP_ROOT* - This variable specifies a relative location to your application inside the
    application GIT repository. In case your application is located in a
    sub-folder, you can set this variable to a *./myapplication*.

* *STI_SCRIPTS_URL* - This variable specifies the location of directory, where *assemble*, *run* and
    *save-artifacts* scripts are downloaded/copied from. By default the scripts
    in this repository will be used, but users can provide an alternative
    location and run their own scripts.
					- Default https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift/sti-nodejs/master/0.10/.sti/bin[<nodejs-version>/.sti/bin]
