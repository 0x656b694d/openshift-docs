== Overview
The OpenShift https://github.com/openshift/sti-python/tree/master/3.3[Python]
image repository contains the sources and Dockerfiles for building various
versions of Python platform images. The resulting images can be run either by
Docker or using https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image[STI].

== Versions
Currently, OpenShift only provides version https://github.com/openshift/sti-python/tree/master/3.3[3.3] of Python.

== Base Images

The following base images are currently available:

* RHEL-7
* CentOS-7

[NOTE]
====
In order to run the build or test action on a RHEL-7 based Python image, you
need to run the build on properly subscribed RHEL-7 machine.
====

== Installation
To build a Python image, choose between a RHEL-7 or CentOS-7 base image:

=== RHEL-7 base image

----
$ git clone https://github.com/openshift/sti-python.git
$ cd sti-python
$ make build TARGET=rhel7 VERSION=3.3
----

=== CentOS-7 Base Image

----
$ git clone https://github.com/openshift/sti-python.git
$ cd sti-python
$ make build VERSION=3.3
----

or just pull it from Docker Hub:

----
$ docker pull openshift/python-33-centos7
----

[NOTE]
====
If you omit the `VERSION` parameter, the build/test action is performed on all
provided versions of Python. Since version `3.3` is the only version provided,
you can omit this parameter.
====

== Usage
To build a simple https://github.com/openshift/sti-python/tree/master/3.3/test/setup-test-app[python-sample-app]
Python application, use a standalone https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image[STI]
and run the resulting image using http://docker.io[Docker]

=== RHEL-7 Base Image

----
$ sti build https://github.com/openshift/sti-python.git --contextDir=3.3/test/setup-test-app/ openshift/python-33-rhel7 python-sample-app
$ docker run -p 8080:8080 python-sample-app
----

=== CentOS-7 Base Image

----
$ sti build https://github.com/openshift/sti-python.git --contextDir=3.3/test/setup-test-app/ openshift/python-33-centos7 python-sample-app
$ docker run -p 8080:8080 python-sample-app
----

To access and test if the application is running:

----
$ curl 127.0.0.1:8080
----

== Test
The OpenShift https://github.com/openshift/sti-python/tree/master/3.3[STI-Python]
repository also provides the STI test framework, which tests the functionality
of a simple Python application built on top of STI-Python image.

=== RHEL7 Base Image

----
$ cd sti-python
$ make test TARGET=rhel7 VERSION=3.3
----

=== CentOS-7 Base Image

----
$ cd sti-python
$ make test VERSION=3.3
----

[NOTE]
====
If you omit the `VERSION` parameter, the build/test action is performed on all
provided versions of Python. Since version `3.3` is the only version provided,
you can omit this parameter.

== Image Name Structure

Use the following image name structure:

****
`openshift/[replaceable]#<platform_name>#-[replaceable]#<platform_version>#-[replaceable]#<base_builder_image>#`
****

Where:

. [replaceable]#<platform_name># - Refers to the STI platform; for example, `python`
. [replaceable]#<platform_version># - The version of the referenced platform, without dots; for example, `33` for Python 3.3
. [replaceable]#<Base_builder_image># - The base OS, such as `rhel7` or `centos7`

.Example image names:
====

----
openshift/python-33-centos7
openshift/python-33-rhel7
----
====

== Environment Variables

To set these environment variables, you can place them into `.sti/environment`
file inside your source code repository.

* [envvar]#APP_FILE# - This variable specifies file name (defaults to `app.py`) passed to the python interpreter which is responsible for launching application.

* [envvar]#APP_MODULE# - This variable specifies WSGI callable. It is of the pattern `$(MODULE_NAME):$(VARIABLE_NAME)`, where module name is a full dotted path and the variable name refers to a inside the specified module. If using `setup.py` for installing the application the module name can be read from that file and variable will default to `application`, eg. see https://github.com/openshift/sti-python/tree/master/3.3/test/setup-test-app[setup-test-app].

* [envvar]#APP_CONFIG# - This variable indicates path to a module which contains http://docs.gunicorn.org/en/latest/configure.html[gunicorn configuration].
