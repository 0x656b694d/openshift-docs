As a developer, you can use the link:../cli_reference/overview.html[OpenShift
CLI] or link:../dev_guide/authentication.html#web-console-authentication[web
console] to log in to an existing OpenShift instance and start
link:../dev_guide/new_app.html[creating new applications]. If your system
administrator has provided them, you can also try out some
link:../dev_guide/templates.html#using-the-quickstart-templates[QuickStart
templates].

If you do not have access to an existing instance and want to install your own,
see the link:administrators.html[Getting Started for Administrators].
