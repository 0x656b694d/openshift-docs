Getting Started for developers is under active development. You can use the
link:../cli_reference/overview.html[OpenShift CLI] or
link:../dev_guide/authentication.html#web-console-authentication[web console] to
log in to an existing OpenShift instance and
link:../dev_guide/new_app.html[start creating applications].

If you do not have access to an existing instance and want to install your own,
see the link:administrators.html[Getting Started for administrators].

*Try It Out*

If you have access to an existing OpenShift instance, you can try it out by
creating an end-to-end application, demonstrating the full OpenShift concept
chain. See the
https://github.com/openshift/origin/blob/master/examples/sample-app[OpenShift 3
Application Lifecycle Sample] for instructions.
