Whether you are a developer or a platform administrator, you can get started
with OpenShift using the following topics:

- link:developers.html[*Developers*] can use the
link:../cli_reference/overview.html[OpenShift CLI] or
link:../dev_guide/authentication.html#management-console-authentication[web
console] to log in to an existing OpenShift instance and
link:../dev_guide/new_app.html[start creating applications].

- link:administrators.html[*Administrators*] can use the
installation utility, an interactive CLI tool, to quickly install and
configure a new OpenShift instance across multiple hosts.

[NOTE]
====
These Getting Started topics are under active development, and will continue to
evolve through the OpenShift beta phases.
