== Overview
OpenShift can be installed using either RPMs or Docker images. However, for OpenShift 3 Beta 1 only the RPM installation method is available. Docker images for OpenShift components will be distributed in a later beta release.

NOTE: Before continuing with the following instructions, ensure that your systems have been properly link:setup.html[set up].

== Using RPMs
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
Installation packages for OpenShift Origin will be made available soon.

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
To install OpenShift using RPM packages, first consult your Red Hat account representative for more details on gaining access to the appropriate repositories during the OpenShift Enterprise 3.0 Beta period.

*Installing and Starting the Master*

Configure the master host with the appropriate yum repository for OpenShift. Then, install the [package]#openshift-master# and [package]#openshift-sdn# packages:

----
# yum install openshift-master openshift-sdn
----

The [package]#openshift-master# package installs everything you need to start the OpenShift master and use the OpenShift link:../using_openshift/cli.html[command line interface] (the `osc` command). The [package]#openshift-sdn# package installs the SDN (which uses link:http://www.openvswitch.org/[Open vSwitch]) used to create the network overlay for communications between nodes.

To start the master, run the `openshift start master` command. Set the `--nodes` option to the host names of your node hosts.

----
# openshift start master --nodes=<node1_hostname>,<node2_hostname>
----

This command:

* starts OpenShift listening on all interfaces (https://0.0.0.0:8443),
* starts the OpenShift web console listening on all interfaces (https://0.0.0.0:8444),
* launches an etcd server to store persistent data, and
* launches the Kubernetes system components.

The web console makes API calls from the browser to the detected master IP address. If that address is not accessible to web console users, specify the IP or hostname to use by passing the `--public-master` option to `openshift start master`.

The server runs in the foreground until you terminate the process.

*Installing and Starting the Nodes*

Configure each node host with the appropriate yum repository for OpenShift. Then, install the [package]#openshift-node# package:

----
# yum install openshift-node
----

NOTE: Currently, nodes must be started as the root user so the Kubernetes proxy can manipulate the iptables rules to expose service ports. However, the link:../using_openshift/cli.html[OpenShift CLI] does not need to be run as root.

To start the nodes, run the `openshift start node` command on each node host. Set the `--master` option to the host name of the master.

----
# openshift start node --master=<master_IP>
----

The server runs in the foreground until you terminate the process.

*What's Next?*

Now that you have a master and nodes running in your OpenShift environment, link:try_it_out.html[try it out] by walking through a sample application lifecycle.

== Using Docker Images
Starting in a later beta release, you will be able to install OpenShift using Docker images. Images will be made available for OpenShift platform components such as masters, etcd, nodes, and routers.
