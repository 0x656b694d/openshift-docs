== Overview

OpenShift can be installed using either RPMs or Docker images on hosts meeting the link:setup.html[system requirements]. Installation packages and images are distributed by Red Hat.

For OpenShift 3 Beta 1, only the RPM installation method is available. Docker images for OpenShift components will be distributed in a later beta release.

== Using RPMs

ifdef::openshift-origin[]
You can install OpenShift using RPM packages, which will be made available for OpenShift Origin soon.

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
You can install OpenShift using RPM packages. Consult your Red Hat account representative for more details on gaining access to the appropriate repositories during the OpenShift Enterprise 3.0 Beta period.

=== Installing OpenShift

After satisfying the system requirements and prerequisites, configure the appropriate yum repository for OpenShift. Then, install the [package]#origin# RPM package:

----
# yum install origin
----

This package installs everything you need to start OpenShift servers or use the OpenShift link:../using_openshift/cli.html[command line interface] (CLI).

NOTE: Currently, OpenShift servers must be started as the root user so the Kubernetes proxy can manipulate the iptables rules to expose service ports. However, the link:../using_openshift/cli.html[OpenShift CLI] does not need to be run as root.

=== Starting the OpenShift Master

On the system you want to be the master host, run the `openshift start master` command. Set the `--cors-allowed-origins` option to the IP address of the master host to allow the Management Console to make requests back to the server. Set the `--nodes` option to the host names of the systems you want to be node hosts.

----
# openshift start master --cors-allowed-origins=<host_ip> \
--nodes=<node1_hostname>,<node2_hostname>
----

This command:

* starts OpenShift listening on all interfaces,
* launches an etcd server to store persistent data, and
* launches the Kubernetes system components.

The server runs in the foreground until you terminate the process.

=== Starting the OpenShift Nodes

On each system you want to be node hosts, run the `openshift start node` command. Set the `--master` option to the host name of the master.

----
# openshift start node --master=<master_IP>
----

The server runs in the foreground until you terminate the process.

=== What's Next?

Now that you have a master and nodes running in your OpenShift environment, link:try_it_out.html[try it out] by walking through a sample application lifecycle.

== Using Docker Images

Starting in a later beta release, you will be able to install OpenShift using Docker images. Images will be made available for OpenShift platform components such as masters, etcd, nodes, and routers.
