== System Requirements
OpenShift components can be installed across multiple hosts. For Beta 1, you can deploy a link:../architecture/kubernetes_infrastructure.html#master[master] on one host, and two link:../architecture/kubernetes_infrastructure.html#node[nodes] on two separate hosts.

The following sections describe the system requirements per component type.

*Masters*

Master hosts must meet the following system requirements:

- Physical or virtual system
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
- Base OS: Fedora 21, CentOS 7, or Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server 7.0
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
- Base OS: Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server 7.0
endif::[]
- 2 vCPU
- Minimum 8 GB RAM
- Minimum 30 GB hard disk space

*Nodes*

Node hosts must meet the following system requirements:

- Physical or virtual system, or an instance running on a public IaaS
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
- Base OS: Fedora 21, CentOS 7, or Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server 7.0
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
- Base OS: Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server 7.0
endif::[]
- 1 vCPU
- Minimum 8 GB RAM
- Minimum 15 GB hard disk space

*Other Beta Requirements*

- You must have a GitHub account or a local (on premise) Git server.
- A shared network must exist between the master and node components.

== Prerequisites
Whether installing OpenShift using RPM packages or Docker images, you must first satisfy the following prerequisites.

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
*Installing Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7*

As mentioned in the system requirements, a base installation of Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 7.0 is required for master or node hosts. See the https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/7/html/Installation_Guide/index.html[Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 Installation Guide] for more information on installing RHEL 7.0.

*Registering with Red Hat Network*

Each system must be registered to Red Hat Network (RHN) and have a RHEL subscription attached to access required packages.

. Register the system and attach a RHEL subscription:
+
----
# subscription-manager register --username=<rhnuser> --password=<rhnpassword>
# subscription-manager list --available   (Find pool ID for RHEL subscription)
# subscription-manager attach --pool=<pool_id>
----

. Ensure the base RHEL repository is enabled, as well:
+
----
# subscription-manager repos --enable=rhel-7-server-rpms
----

. At this point, you can update the system to the latest RHEL base packages:
+
----
# yum update
----
endif::[]

*Security Warning*

OpenShift runs Docker containers on your system, and in some cases, such as build operations and the registry service, it does so using privileged containers. Furthermore, those containers access your host's Docker daemon and perform `docker build` and `docker push` operations. As such, you should be aware of the inherent security risks associated with performing `docker run` operations on arbitrary images as they effectively have root access. This is particularly relevant when running the OpenShift nodes directly on your host system.

For more information, see these articles:

- http://opensource.com/business/14/7/docker-security-selinux
- https://docs.docker.com/articles/security/

The OpenShift security model will continue to evolve and tighten as we head towards production ready code.

*Installing Docker*

Docker must be installed and running on master and node hosts before installing OpenShift.

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
. In RHEL 7.0, Docker is provided in the RHEL Extras repository; first, ensure the RHEL Extras repository is enabled:
+
----
# subscription-manager repos --enable=rhel-7-server-extras-rpms
----
endif::[]

. Install Docker:
+
----
# yum install docker
----

. Edit the [filename]#/etc/sysconfig/docker# file and add `--insecure-registry 172.30.17.0/24` to the [parameter]#OPTIONS# parameter. For example:
+
----
OPTIONS=--selinux-enabled -H fd:// --insecure-registry 172.30.17.0/24
----
+
The `--insecure-registry` option instructs the Docker daemon to trust any Docker registry on the 172.30.17.0/24 subnet, rather than requiring a certificate.
+
NOTE: These instructions assume you have not changed the kubernetes/openshift service subnet configuration from the default value of 172.30.17.0/24.

. OpenShift [sysitem]#firewalld# rules are currently a work in progress. In Beta 1, properly configure or disable the [service]#firewalld# service. To configure it, add `docker0` to the public zone:
+
----
# firewall-cmd --zone=trusted --change-interface=docker0
# systemctl restart firewalld
----
+
Alternatively, stop and disable the service:
+
----
# systemctl stop firewalld
# systemctl disable firewalld
----

. You can now enable and start the [service]#Docker# service:
+
----
# systemctl enable docker
# systemctl start docker
----

*What's Next?*

Now that your hosts are properly set up, you can link:installation.html[install OpenShift].
