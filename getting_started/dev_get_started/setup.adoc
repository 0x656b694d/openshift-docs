== Overview
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
OpenShift components can be installed across multiple hosts. The following sections outline the system requirements and instructions for preparing your environment and hosts before installing OpenShift.
endif::[]

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
OpenShift components can be installed across multiple hosts. During the Beta 1
phase, we recommend installing a
link:../../architecture/infrastructure_components/kubernetes_infrastructure.html#master[master]
on one host, and two
link:../../architecture/infrastructure_components/kubernetes_infrastructure.html#node[nodes]
on two separate hosts.
endif::[]

== System Requirements
The system requirements vary per host type:

[cols="1,7"]
|===
|Masters a|- Physical or virtual system
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
- Base OS: Fedora 21, CentOS 7, or RHEL 7.1 Beta ("Minimal" installation option)
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
- Base OS: RHEL 7.1 Beta ("Minimal" installation option)
endif::[]
- 2 vCPU
- Minimum 8 GB RAM
- Minimum 30 GB hard disk space

| Nodes a| - Physical or virtual system, or an instance running on a public IaaS
ifdef::openshift-origin[]

endif::[]

- Minimum 15 GB hard disk space

*Security Warning*

OpenShift runs Docker containers on your system, and in some cases, such as build operations and the registry service, it does so using privileged containers. Furthermore, those containers access your host's Docker daemon and perform `docker build` and `docker push` operations. As such, you should be aware of the inherent security risks associated with performing `docker run` operations on arbitrary images as they effectively have root access.

For more information, see these articles:

- http://opensource.com/business/14/7/docker-security-selinux
- https://docs.docker.com/articles/security/

OpenShift will increase the security constraints on containers in later beta releases.

== Environment Requirements
*DNS*

A wildcard for a DNS zone must ultimately resolve to the IP address of the OpenShift link:../../architecture/core_objects/routing.html[router]. During the Beta 1 phase, this guide ensures that the router ends up on the OpenShift master host.

Create a wildcard DNS entry for `cloudapps`, or something similar, that has a low TTL and points to the public IP address of the master. For example:

----
*.cloudapps.example.com. 300 IN  A 192.168.133.2
----

In almost all cases, when referencing VMs you must use host names, and the host names that you use must match the output of the `hostname -f` command on each node. By extension, you must at least have all host name and IP mappings in [filename]#/etc/hosts# files or forward DNS should work.

*Networking*

A shared network must exist between the master and node hosts.

*Git*

You must have either Internet access and a GitHub account, or read and write access to an internal, HTTP-based Git server.

== Host Preparation
Before installing OpenShift, you must first prepare each host per the following.

ifdef::openshift-origin[]
NOTE: If you are using https://www.vagrantup.com[Vagrant] to run OpenShift Origin, you can do not need to go through the following sections. These changes are only necessary when you are setting up the host system yourself. If you are using Vagrant, see the https://github.com/openshift/origin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.adoc#develop-on-virtual-machine-using-vagrant[Contributing Guide], then you can skip directly to trying out the link:try_it_out.html[sample applications].
endif::[]

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
*Installing Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7*

As mentioned in the system requirements, a base installation of Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 7.1 Beta is required for master or node hosts. See the https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/7-Beta/html/Installation_Guide/index.html[Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.1 Beta Installation Guide] for more information.

*Registering with Red Hat Network*

Each system must be registered to Red Hat Network (RHN) and have a RHEL subscription attached to access required packages.

. Register the system and attach a RHEL subscription:
+
----
# subscription-manager register --username=<rhnuser> --password=<rhnpassword>
# subscription-manager list --available   (Find pool ID for RHEL subscription)
# subscription-manager attach --pool=<pool_id>
----

. Ensure the base RHEL repository is enabled, as well:
+
----
# subscription-manager repos --enable=rhel-7-server-rpms
----

endif::[]

*Managing Base Packages*

. Remove [sysitem]#NetworkManager#:
+
----
# yum remove NetworkManager*
----

. Install the following packages:
+
----
# yum install wget git vim-enhanced net-tools bind-utils \
tmux iptables-services bridge-utils
----

. Update the system to the latest packages:
+
----
# yum update
----

*Installing Docker*

Docker must be installed and running on master and node hosts before installing OpenShift.

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
. In RHEL 7, Docker is provided in the RHEL Extras repository; first, ensure the RHEL Extras repository is enabled:
+
----
# subscription-manager repos --enable=rhel-7-server-extras-rpms
----
endif::[]

. Install Docker:
+
----
# yum install docker
----

. Edit the [filename]#/etc/sysconfig/docker# file and add `--insecure-registry 172.30.0.0/16` to the [parameter]#OPTIONS# parameter. For example:
+
----
OPTIONS=--selinux-enabled --insecure-registry 172.30.0.0/16
----
+
The `--insecure-registry` option instructs the Docker daemon to trust any Docker registry on the 172.30.0.0/16 subnet, rather than requiring a certificate.
+
NOTE: These instructions assume you have not changed the Kubernetes/OpenShift service subnet configuration from the default value of 172.30.0.0/16.

. OpenShift [sysitem]#firewalld# rules are currently a work in progress. During the Beta 1 phase, properly configure or disable the [sysitem]#firewalld# service. To configure it, add `docker0` to the public zone:
+
----
# firewall-cmd --zone=trusted --change-interface=docker0
# systemctl restart firewalld
----
+
Alternatively, stop and disable the service:
+
----
# systemctl stop firewalld
# systemctl disable firewalld
----

. Enable and start the [service]#Docker# service:
+
----
# systemctl enable docker
# systemctl start docker
----

. Add `iptables` port rules for OpenShift by editing the [filename]#/etc/sysconfig/iptables# file. During the Beta 1 phase, the port range is wide open, but it will be significantly closed in future releases. In between the following rules:
+
----
-A INPUT -m state --state RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
-A INPUT -p icmp -j ACCEPT
----
+
Add these rules:
+
----
 -A INPUT -p tcp -m state --state NEW -m tcp --dport 10250 -j ACCEPT
 -A INPUT -p tcp -m state --state NEW -m tcp --dport 8443:8444 -j ACCEPT
 -A INPUT -p tcp -m state --state NEW -m tcp --dport 7001 -j ACCEPT
 -A INPUT -p tcp -m state --state NEW -m tcp --dport 4001 -j ACCEPT
 -A INPUT -p tcp -m state --state NEW -m tcp --dport 443 -j ACCEPT
 -A INPUT -p tcp -m state --state NEW -m tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT
----

. Enable the [sysitem]#iptables# service:
+
----
# systemctl enable iptables
----

. Restart the [sysitem]#iptables# and [sysitem]#docker# services:
+
----
# systemctl restart iptables
# systemctl restart docker
----

*What's Next?*

Now that your environment and hosts are properly set up, you can link:installation.html[install OpenShift].
