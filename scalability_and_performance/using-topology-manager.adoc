Topology Manager is a Kubelet component that collects hints from CPU Manager,
Device Manager, and other Hint Providers to align pod resources (such as CPU, SR-IOV VFs,
and other device resources) for all QoS classes on the same non-uniform memory access
(NUMA) node.

Topology Manager uses topology information from collected hints to decide if
the pod can be accepted or rejected on the node, based on the configured Topology
Manager policy and Pod resources requested.

Topology Manager is useful for workloads that desire to use hardware accelerators
to support latency-critical execution and high throughput parallel computation.
