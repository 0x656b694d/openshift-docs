== Overview
Applications have always been a focal point within OpenShift.  In OpenShift v2, an application was very well defined in that it consisted of 1 web framework and no more than 1 of any given cartridge type.  So you could have 1 php and 1 mysql for example.  But you couldn't have 1 ruby, 1 php, and 2 mysqls.  You also couldn't have a mysql by itself.

The limited scoping for applications meant that OpenShift could perform seamless linking for all components within an application via well defined environment variables.  Every web framework knew how to connect to mysql with OPENSHIFT_MYSQL_DB_HOST and OPENSHIFT_MYSQL_DB_PORT for example.  But this linking was limited to within an application and only worked within cartridges designed to work together.  There wasn't anything to help linking across application components such as sharing a mysql across 2 applications.

What was clear from v2 is that solving the problems of the entire application is essential.  Most other PaaSes limit themselves to web frameworks and rely on external services for the other types of components.  OpenShift v3 takes the next steps making even more application topologies possible and existing topologies more manageable.

The first step necessary to accomplish this is to remove "application" as a keyword since application means something different to everyone.  Instead you can have as many components as you desire, contained by a project, flexibly linked together, and optionally labelled to provide any groupings/structure.  This model allows for a standalone mysql, or a mysql shared between jboss components, or really any combination of components you can imagine.

Flexible linking means you can link any two arbitrary components together.  As long as one component can export environment variables and the second component consume values from those environment variables, with potential variable name transformation, you can link together any two components without having to change the images they are based on.  So the best containerized implementation of your desired database and web framework can be consumed directly rather than you having to fork them both and rework to be compatible.

The result means you can build anything on OpenShift.  And that's the problem OpenShift really aims to solve.  A platform built on containers that lets you build entire applications in a repeatable lifecycle.
