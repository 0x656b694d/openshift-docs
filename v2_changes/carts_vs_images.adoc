== Overview
Cartridges in OpenShift v2 were the focal point of building an application.  Each cartridge provided libraries, source code, build mechanisms, connection logic, routing logic, and a pre configured environment to run a component of your application.

But cartridges weren't perfect.  They lacked a clean separation of user vs cartridge content which meant for example users didn't own the home directory of each gear.  They weren't the best distribution mechanism for large binaries.  While you could use external dependencies from within cartridges, doing so lost the niceties of encapsulation.

== Collocation
Cartridges could be collocated within gears but images map 1:1 with containers.  Containers use pods as their collocation mechanism.
