== Overview
Cartridges in OpenShift v2 were the focal point for building applications.  Each cartridge provided the required libraries, source code, build mechanisms, connection logic, and routing logic along with a preconfigured environment to run the components of your applications.

However, with cartridges there was no clear distinction between the developer content and the cartridge content. For example, one limitation was that you did not have ownership of the home directory on each gear of your application. Another disadvantage was that cartridges were not the best distribution mechanism for large binaries. While you could use external dependencies from within cartridges, doing so would lose the benefits of encapsulation.

== Collocation
Whereas cartridges in OpenShift v2 could be collocated within gears, images are mapped 1:1 with containers. Containers use pods as their collocation mechanism.
