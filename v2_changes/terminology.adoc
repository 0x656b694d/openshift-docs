== Overview
Because of the architectural changes in OpenShift v3, a number of core terms used in OpenShift v2 were re-evaluated or done away with to better reflect the new model. The following sections highlight some of these important changes. See the link:../architecture/openshift_model.html[OpenShift Model] topic for more detailed information on the resources in the new model.

*Application*

The "application" term or concept no longer exists in OpenShift v3. See the link:applications.html[Applications] topic for a more in-depth look at this change.

*Cartridge vs Image*

The easiest replacement term for "cartridge" in OpenShift v3 is "image". An image does more than a cartridge from a packaging perspective, providing better encapsulation and flexibility. But the cartridge concept also included logic for building, deploying, and routing which do not exist in images. In OpenShift v3, these additional needs are meet by Source-to-Image and templated configuration.

See the link:carts_vs_images.html[Cartridges vs Images] topic for more detailed information on these changes.

*Project vs Domain*

"Project" is essentially a rename of "domain" from OpenShift v2.  Projects do have several features that are not a part of domains in OpenShift v2.

*Gear vs Container*

The "gear" and "container" terms are interchangeable. Containers have a cleaner mapping of being 1:1 with images whereas many cartridges could be added to a single gear. With containers, the collocation concept is satisfied by pods.

*Master vs Broker*

"Masters" in OpenShift v3 do the job of the "broker" layer in OpenShift v2. However, the MongoDB and ActiveMQ layers used by the broker in OpenShift v2 are no longer necessary because [sysitem]#etcd# is typically installed with each master.
