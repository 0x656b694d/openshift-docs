[role="_abstract"]
{product-title} ({product-title-short}) provides the option to configure your system to automatically delete inactive clusters so that you can monitor active clusters only. If this feature is enabled, when Central has been unable to reach Sensor in a cluster for the period of time configured in the *Decomissioned cluster age* field, the cluster is considered inactive. Inactive clusters are subject to deletion. You can configure automatic removal of inactive cluster settings by using the {product-title-short} portal or the application programming interface (API). You can specify not to delete an inactive cluster by adding a label for the cluster when configuring this feature.

Automatic removal of inactive clusters is disabled by default. To enable this setting, enter a nonzero number in the *Decommissioned cluster age* field, as described in the following procedure. The *Decommissioned cluster age* field indicates the number of days that a cluster can remain unreachable before it is considered inactive. When a cluster is inactive, the *Clusters* page displays the status of the cluster. Inactive clusters are indicated with the `unhealthy` label and the window shows the number of days after which the cluster will be deleted if it continues to remain inactive. After a cluster is deleted, the deletion is documented with an `info` log in the Central logs.

[NOTE]
====
There is a 24-hour grace period after enabling this setting before clusters are deleted. The cluster that hosts Central is never deleted.
