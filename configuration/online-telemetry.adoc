{product-title} includes online telemetry, that is, it optionally gathers data about {product-title} and its components.
The online telemetry data includes various operational and usage metrics, as well as information about the size, shape, and possible adverse conditions of the environments {product-title} components are running in.

{product-title} does not collect node names, IP addresses, or other identifiable information about your infrastructure.
See the xref:../configuration/online-telemetry.adoc#online-telemetry-collected-data_online-telemetry[collected data] section for detailed information about the data {product-title} collects.

Red Hat uses the collected data to analyze anomalies, fix problems, and improve the quality of future {product-title} versions based on real-world usage.
{product-title} transmits online telemetry data over a TLS-encrypted connection with negligible performance and network traffic impact.

[WARNING]
====
* If you control egress traffic from your Central deployment, you must allow outgoing connections to `telemetry.stackrox.io` on TCP port number 443.
* If you are using {product-title} in offline mode, online telemetry does not send any data.
However, Red Hat recommends that you xref:../configuration/generate-diagnostic-bundle.adoc#generate-diagnostic-bundle[generate the diagnostic bundle] and attach it when you create a support case.

== Enabling or disabling online telemetry

Online telemetry is enabled by default when you install {product-title}. You can disable it during the installation or on an existing {product-title} instance.

When you disable online telemetry and upgrade to a new version, it remains disabled and you must manually enable it.

[NOTE]
====
Red Hat uses the online telemetry data to provide you with an up-to-date, more secure, and better-performing product.
Therefore, to help us improve {product-title}, Red Hat recommends leaving online telemetry enabled.
