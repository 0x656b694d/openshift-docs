toc::[]

This document describes the process to replace a single etcd member. This procedure assumes that there is still an etcd quorum in the cluster.

[NOTE]
====
If you have lost the majority of your master hosts, leading to etcd quorum loss, then you must follow the disaster recovery procedure to xref:../backup_and_restore/disaster_recovery/scenario-1-infra-recovery.adoc#dr-infrastructure-recovery[recover from lost master hosts] instead of this procedure.

If the control plane certificates are not valid on the member being replaced, then you must follow the procedure to xref:../backup_and_restore/disaster_recovery/scenario-3-expired-certs.adoc#dr-recovering-expired-certs[recover from expired control plane certificates] instead of this procedure.

To replace a single master host:

* xref:../backup_and_restore/replacing-failed-master.adoc#restore-remove-failed-master_replacing-failed-master-host[Remove the member from the etcd cluster].

* If the etcd certificates for the master host are valid, then xref:../backup_and_restore/replacing-failed-master.adoc#restore-add-master_replacing-failed-master-host[add the member back to the etcd cluster].

* If there are no etcd certificates for the master host or they are no longer valid, then xref:../backup_and_restore/replacing-failed-master.adoc#restore-regenerate-etcd-certs_replacing-failed-master-host[generate etcd certificates and add the member to the etcd cluster].

== Adding the member back to the cluster

After you have removed the member from the etcd cluster, use one of the following procedures to add the member to the cluster:

* If the etcd certificates for the master host are valid, then xref:../backup_and_restore/replacing-failed-master.adoc#restore-add-master_replacing-failed-master-host[add the member back to the etcd cluster].

* If there are no etcd certificates for the master host or they are no longer valid, then xref:../backup_and_restore/replacing-failed-master.adoc#restore-regenerate-etcd-certs_replacing-failed-master-host[generate etcd certificates and add the member to the etcd cluster].

// Adding a master host back to the cluster
include::modules/restore-add-master.adoc[leveloffset=+2]

// Generating etcd certificates and adding the member to the cluster
