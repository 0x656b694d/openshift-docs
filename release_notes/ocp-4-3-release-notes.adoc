Red Hat {product-title} provides developers and IT organizations with a hybrid
cloud application platform for deploying both new and existing applications on
secure, scalable resources with minimal configuration and management overhead.

frameworks, such as Java, JavaScript, Python, Ruby, and PHP.

Built on Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Kubernetes, {product-title}
provides a more secure and scalable multi-tenant operating system for todayâ€™s
enterprise-class applications, while delivering integrated application runtimes
and libraries. {product-title} enables organizations to meet security, privacy,
compliance, and governance requirements.

[id="ocp-4-3-about-this-release"]
== About this release

Red Hat {product-title}
(link:https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2019:1234[RHBA-2019:1234]) is now
available. This release uses Kubernetes 1.16 with CRI-O runtime. New features,
changes, and known issues that pertain to {product-title} {product-version} are
included in this topic.

{product-title} {product-version} clusters are available at
https://cloud.redhat.com/openshift. The {cloud-redhat-com}
application for {product-title} allows you to deploy OpenShift clusters to
either on-premise or cloud environments.

{product-title} {product-version} is supported on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.6 and
later, as well as Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS 4.1.

You must use {op-system-first} for the control plane, or master, machines and
can use either {op-system} or Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.6 for compute, or worker,
machines.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Because only Red Hat Enterprise Linux version 7.6 is supported for compute
machines, you must not upgrade the Red Hat Enterprise Linux compute machines to
version 8.

== New features and enhancements

This release adds improvements related to the following components and concepts.

[id="ocp-4-3-installation-and-upgrade"]
=== Installation and upgrade

[id="ocp-4-3-phased-rollout"]
==== {product-title} upgrades phased rollout

In {product-title} 4.1, Red Hat introduced the concept of upgrade channels for
recommending the appropriate upgrade versions to your cluster. Upgrade channels
separate upgrade strategies and also are used to control the cadence of updates.
Channels are tied to a minor version of {product-title}. For instance,
{product-title} {product-version} channels will never include an upgrade to a
4.4 release. This ensures administrators make an explicit decision to upgrade to
the next minor version of {product-title}. Channels only control updates and
have no impact on the version of the cluster you install; the
`openshift-install` binary for a given patch level of  {product-title} always
installs that patch level.

See link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/4495171[OpenShift 4.x Upgrades
phased roll out] for more information on the types of updates and upgrade
channels.

Because upgrades are published to the channels as they are gradually rolled out
to customers based on data from the Red Hat Service Reliability Engineering
(SRE) team, you might not immediately see notification in the web console that
updates from version 4.2.z to 4.3 are available at initial release.
