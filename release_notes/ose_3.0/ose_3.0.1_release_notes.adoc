== OpenShift Enterprise 3.0.1

OpenShift Enterprise release 3.0.1.0
(https://access.redhat.com/errata/product/290/ver=3.0.0.0/rhel---7/x86_64/RHBA-2015:1540[RHBA-2015:1540])
is now available.

[IMPORTANT]
====
For any release, always review the Administrator Guide for instructions on
link:../install_config/upgrades.html[upgrading your OpenShift cluster] properly,
including any additional steps that may be required for a specific release.
====

This release includes the following enhancements and bug fixes:

*Backwards Compatibility*

.API
* The `pods/exec` endpoint is being moved to `POST` instead of `GET`. For
backwards compatibility, `GET` continues to be supported. Clients will try to
use `POST`, and if that fails, will try to use `GET`. If you have an existing
deployment, the default policy will need to be updated prior to 1.1.0. See
https://github.com/openshift/origin/issues/3717[Issue #3717] for more
information.
* The `*hostDir*` volume type has been renamed `*hostPath*` in all `*Pod*` and
`*PodTemplate*` objects.
* `*Pod*`: The `*serviceAccount*` field changed to `*serviceAccountName*`.
OpenShift will continue to accept and output both fields, but
`*serviceAccountName*` takes precedence.
* `*Pod*`: The `*host*` field changed to `*nodeName*`. OpenShift will continue
to accept and output both fields, but `*nodeName*` takes precedence.
* `*Service*`: The `*portalIP*` field changed to `*clusterIP*`. OpenShift will
continue to accept and output both fields, but `*clusterIP*` takes precedence.
* `*Service*`: The protocol for a port under a `*Service*`, `*Endpoint*`, or
`*Container*` must be uppercased: *TCP* instead of *tcp*, and *UDP* instead of
*udp*. OpenShift will continue to accept all case variations.

.Stored Objects
* Build pods previously inherited the labels of the build. This resulted in
pods from builds being accidentally included in deployments that had
similar labels. It was never intended that build pods should share labels
with existing components, so this behavior has been removed. Queries that
attempt to retrieve build pods by label will no longer work.

*Enhancements*

.For Administrators
* Kubernetes was updated to v1.0.0.
* To make it easier to link:../install_config/upgrades.html[upgrade your cluster],
the `oadm reconcile-cluster-roles` command has been added to
link:../install_config/upgrades.html#updating-policy-definitions[update your
cluster roles] to match the internal default. Use this command to verify that
cluster infrastructure users have the appropriate permissions.
* A new
link:../admin_guide/configuring_authentication.html#LDAPPasswordIdentityProvider[LDAP
authentication identity provider] has been added, allowing administrators to
configure OpenShift to verify passwords and users against an LDAP server
directly.
* The master's CA certificate can be made available as a secret inside pods,
making it easier to manage secure TLS inside the cluster. To enable this in an
existing configuration,
link:../admin_guide/service_accounts.html#enable-service-account-authentication[set
the `*masterCA*` field] in the
link:../admin_guide/master_node_configuration.html#master-configuration-files[master
configuration file].
* The current version of the master is now shown on startup, and startup
logging has been cleaned up.
* The ability to use host ports and the `*hostNetwork*` option is now properly
secured by
link:../architecture/additional_concepts/authorization.html#security-context-constraints[security
context constraints] (SCCs), and only restricted or higher users can use them.
* The `*RunAsNonRoot*` option for pod SCCs has been added. It is now possible to
restrict users to running pods that are non-root (i.e., pods that have an
explicit *USER* numeric value set in their Docker image or have specified the
user ID on their pod SCC).

.For Developers
* Output for `oc status` has been improved to make it easier to see the types of
objects being presented.
* You can now search for images, templates, and other inputs for the `oc
new-app` command using the `--search` and `--list` flags. For example, to find
all of the images or templates that include PHP:
+
----
$ oc new-app --search php
----
* The `oc new-app` command now always adds an `app=<name>` label on any created
objects when you do not specify labels with `--labels`. The name is inferred
from `--name` or the name of the first component passed to the command. For
example:
+
----
$ oc new-app php
----
+
adds a label `app=php` to all of objects it creates. You can then easily delete
all of those components using:
+
----
$ oc delete all -l app=php
----
* The `oc rsh <pod>` command has been added, which is a shortcut for:
+
----
$ oc exec -itp POD -- bash
----
+
The new command makes it easier to get a remote shell into your pods.
* Rolling updates can now be performed by percentage. For example, you can specify the percentage of pods to update by a negative or positive amount that
adjusts the amount of replicas in chunks. If negative, old deployments are
scaled down first. If positive, extra pods are created first. The rolling update
works to keep the desired amount of pods running (100% of the old deployment
size when a positive percentage or 100%-`*UpdatePercent*` when negative) as it
goes.

*Bug Fixes*

.For Cluster Administrators
* The `openshift start --print-ip` command was added, which reports the IP that
the master will use if no `--master` address is provided, then exits.
* OpenShift performance when idling has been improved by removing an inefficient
timer loop.
* The router and internal registry now default to using the `*RollingUpdate*`
strategy deployment. Red Hat recommends updating any existing router or
registry installations if you plan on scaling them up to multiple pods.
* The `oadm policy who-can` command now shows additional information.
* Master startup no longer has a chance to generate certificates with duplicate
serial numbers, which previously rendered them unusable.

.For Developers
* For the `oc new-app` command:
** http://www.scala-lang.org/[Scala] Git repositories are now detected.
** A bug was fixed where explicit tags were being set on new image streams,
 which confused builds.
** Ports are now exposed that were defined in the source *_Dockerfile_* when
 creating an application from a Git repository.
** The *FROM* instruction in a *_Dockerfile_* can now point to an image stream
 or invalid image.
** For any image that has volumes, `*emptyDir*` volumes are now created and the
user is informed.
** All ports defined on the image can now be exposed on the generated service.
** The `--name` argument now also changes
the name of the image stream.
** Labels passed with `--labels` are now properly set onto the pod template and
selector for the deployment.
* The `oc status` command now shows standalone replication controllers and a
number of other warnings about issues.
* The timeout for log sessions and the `oc exec` and `oc portforward` commands
has been increased from 5 minutes to 1 hour.
* Cleanup and improvements were made to the *Browse* pages in the web console,
including a better layout at smaller resolutions.
* OpenShift now avoids writing excessive log errors on initial deployments when
the image is not yet available.
* https://quay.io/[Quay.io] registries are now supported by using cookies when
importing images.
* Docker images of the form *<registry>/<name>* are now properly handled by the
`oc new-app` command and the image import functionality.
* Secret volumes are now unique for push and pull secrets during builds.
* The `oc secret` commands now provide better usage errors.
* Builds are now filtered by completion time in the *Overview* page of the web
console.
* A race condition was fixed when service accounts with *_.dockercfg_* files
(for pull secrets) were deleted.
* When generating and adding secrets to a service account, the `oc secrets add`
command now allows the user to specify which type of secret is being added:
`mount` or `pull`.
* The custom builder build type now allows image output to be disabled instead
of requiring it on input.
* WebSocket errors in the web console are now handled more effectively.
* The `*http_proxy*` and `*HTTP_PROXY*` environment variables can now be passed
to builds.
* Routes now default to using the route name when creating a virtual host, not
the service name.
* The `oc expose` command no longer defaults to creating routes, except when a
service is exposed.
* More detail is now shown on the image streams page in the web console.
* Source code revision information is now shown in the `oc describe build`
output.
* TLS termination output is now shown in `oc describe route` output.
* Image importing now works with registries that do not implement the whole
Docker Registry API (e.g., Pulp read-only registries).
* Deployment configurations now trigger deployment when the `*metadata*` field
of the pod template is changed, not just when the `*spec*` is changed.
* The project request template now allows Kubernetes objects as well as
OpenShift objects.
* The `oc volume` command can now change the volume type when the `--mount-path`
is unambiguous.
* Builds now properly cancel when the user requests them, rather than running to
completion.
* The `oc export` command no longer fails when exporting image streams that do
not have tags under their `*spec*`.
* Attempting to use the default PostgreSQL database service templates after
using a default MySQL template failed with errors reporting "mysql" already
exists. This was due to an incorrect value in the PostgreSQL templates, which
has now been fixed.
(https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1245559[BZ#1245559])
* Previously when creating from templates in the web console, the creation would
fail if the template contained certain API object types, including persistent
volume claims, secrets, and service accounts. This was due to the web console
missing these types from its API type map. The type map has now been updated
to include these missing types, and the web console also now gracefully
handles unrecognized object types, reporting a relevant error message.
(https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1244254[BZ#1244254])
* The web console previously produced errors when users attempted to create from
templates that had a Custom build strategy. The errors obscured the template
parameters from being shown or managed. The web console has now been updated
to properly handle Custom and Docker build strategies in templates. As a
result, the errors no longer occur, and template parameters can be viewed and
managed. (https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1242312[BZ#1242312])
* If the *nfs-utils* package was not installed on a node host, when a user tried
to add an NFS volume to an application, the mount operation would fail for the
pod. This bug fix adds the *nfs-utils* package as a dependency for the
*openshift-node* package so it is installed on all node hosts by default.
(https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1238565[BZ#1238565])
* Previously, pruning images associated with an image stream that had been
removed would fail. This bug fix updates layer pruning to always delete blobs
from the registry, even if the image stream(s) that referenced the layer no
longer exists. In the event that there are no longer any image streams
referencing the layer, the blob can still be deleted, but not the registry
image repository layer link files.
(https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1237271[BZ#1237271])
* The *Documentation* link in the header of the web console previously linked to
the latest OpenShift Origin documentation. It has been updated to now point to
the OpenShift Enterprise documentation for the current version.
(https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1233772[BZ#1233772])
* The *Create* page in the web console has been updated to make it more obvious
that there are two options rather than one. The headings have been modified to
"Create Using Your Code" and "Create Using a Template", and a separator has
been added between the two options.
(https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1233488[BZ#1233488])
* Previously using the CLI, labels could be set to empty values, and setting
labels to invalid values produced an unfriendly error. This bug fix updates
the CLI to no longer allow setting labels to empty values, and setting labels
to invalid values produces a better error message.
