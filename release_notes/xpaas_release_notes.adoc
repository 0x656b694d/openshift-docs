== Overview

xPaaS images for OpenShift Enterprise 3.0 are provided for Red Hat JBoss
Enterprise Application Platform, Red Hat JBoss Web Server, and Red Hat
JBoss A-MQ.

=== xPaaS Image for Red Hat JBoss EAP

With this release, Red Hat JBoss EAP is available as a containerized
xPaaS image that is designed for use with OpenShift Enterprise 3.0.

However, there are link:../using_images/xpaas_images/eap.html[significant
differences] in supported configurations and functionality in the JBoss EAP
xPaaS image compared to the regular release of JBoss EAP. Documentation for
other JBoss EAP functionality not specific to the JBoss EAP xPaaS image can be
found in the
https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/JBoss_Enterprise_Application_Platform/[JBoss
EAP documentation on the Red Hat Customer Portal].

=== xPaaS Image for Red Hat JWS

With this release, the Apache Tomcat 7 and Apache Tomcat 8 components of
Red Hat JBoss Web Server 3 are available as containerized xPaaS images
that are designed for use with OpenShift Enterprise 3.0.

However, there are link:../using_images/xpaas_images/jws.html[significant
differences] in the functionality between the JBoss Web Server xPaaS images and
the regular release of JBoss Web Server. Documentation for other JBoss Web
Server functionality not specific to the JBoss Web Server xPaaS images can be
found in the
https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_JBoss_Web_Server/[JBoss
Web Server documentation on the Red Hat Customer Portal].

=== xPaaS Image for Red Hat JBoss A-MQ

With this release, Red Hat JBoss A-MQ is available as a containerized
xPaaS image that is designed for use with OpenShift Enterprise 3.0. It
allows developers to quickly deploy an A-MQ message broker in a hybrid
cloud environment.

However, there are significant differences in supported configurations and
functionality in the JBoss A-MQ image
compared to the regular release of JBoss A-MQ. Documentation for other
JBoss A-MQ functionality not specific to the JBoss A-MQ xPaaS image can
be found in the
https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_JBoss_A-MQ/[JBoss A-MQ documentation on the Red Hat Customer Portal].

== Known Issues for xPaaS Images

The following are the current known issues along with any known workarounds:

*JWS*

* https://issues.jboss.org/browse/CLOUD-57[https://issues.jboss.org/browse/CLOUD-57]: Tomcat's access log valve logs to file in container instead of
stdout
+
Due to this issue, the logging data is not available for the central logging
facility. To work around this issue, use the `oc exec` command to get the
contents of the log file.

* https://issues.jboss.org/browse/CLOUD-153[https://issues.jboss.org/browse/CLOUD-153]: `mvn clean` in JWS STI can fail
+
Cleaning up after a build in JWS STI is not possible, because the Maven command
`mvn clean` fails. This is due to Maven not being able to build the object model
during startup.
+
To work around this issue, add Red Hat and JBoss repositories into the
*_pom.xml_* file of the application if the application uses dependencies from
there.

* https://issues.jboss.org/browse/CLOUD-156[https://issues.jboss.org/browse/CLOUD-156]: Datasource realm configuration is incorrect for JWS
+
It is not possible to do correct JNDI lookup for datasources in the current JWS
image if an invalid combination of datasource and realm properties is defined.
If a datasource is configured in the *_context.xml_* file and a realm in the
*_server.xml_* file, then the *_server.xml_* file's `*localDataSource*` property
should be set to *true*.

*EAP*

* https://issues.jboss.org/browse/CLOUD-61[https://issues.jboss.org/browse/CLOUD-61]: JPA application fails to start when the database is not available
+
JPA applications fail to deploy in the EAP OpenShift Enterprise 3.0 image if an
underlying database instance that the EAP instance relies on is not available at
the start of the deployment. The EAP application tries to contact the database
for initialization, but because it is not available, the server starts but the
application fails to deploy.
+
There are no known workarounds available at this stage for this issue.

* https://issues.jboss.org/browse/CLOUD-158[https://issues.jboss.org/browse/CLOUD-158]: Continuous HornetQ errors after scale down "Failed to create netty
connection"
+
In the EAP image, an application not using messaging complains about messaging
errors related to HornetQ when being scaled.
+
Since there are no configuration options to disable messaging to work around
this issue, simply include the *_standalone-openshift.xml_* file within the
source of the image and remove or alter the following lines related to
messaging:
+
----
Line 18:

<!-- ##MESSAGING_EXTENSION## -->

Line 318:

<!-- ##MESSAGING_SUBSYSTEM## -->
----

* https://issues.jboss.org/browse/CLOUD-161[https://issues.jboss.org/browse/CLOUD-161]:
EAP pod serving requests before it joins cluster, some sessions reset after
failure
+
In a distributed web application deployed on an EAP image, a new container
starts serving requests before it joins the cluster.
+
There are no known workarounds available at this stage for this issue.

*EAP and JWS*

* https://issues.jboss.org/browse/CLOUD-159[https://issues.jboss.org/browse/CLOUD-159]: Database pool configurations should contain validation SQL setting
+
In both the EAP and JWS images, when restarting a crashed database instance, the
connection pools contain stale connections.
+
To work around this issue, restart all instances in case of a database failure.

*A-MQ*

There are no known issues in the A-MQ image.
