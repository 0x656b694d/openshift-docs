{product-title} 4.10 introduces support for installing a cluster on IBM Cloud using installer-provisioned infrastructure.

//For more information, see ../installing/installing_ibm_cloud_public/preparing-to-install-on-ibm-cloud.adoc#preparing-to-install-on-ibm-cloud[Preparing to install on IBM Cloud].

[id="ocp-4-10-installation-and-upgrade-vsphere-provisioning"]
==== Thin provisioning support for VMware vSphere cluster installation

{product-title} {product-version} introduces support for thin provisioned disks when you install a cluster using installer-provisioned infrastructure. You can provision disks as `thin`, `thick`, or `eagerZeroedThick`. For more information about disk provisioning modes in VMware vSphere, see xref:../installing/installing_vsphere/installing-vsphere-installer-provisioned-customizations.html#installation-configuration-parameters_installing-vsphere-installer-provisioned-customizations[Installation configuration parameters].

[id="ocp-4-10-installation-and-upgrade-aws-ami"]
==== Installing a cluster into an Amazon Web Services GovCloud region

{op-system-first} Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) are now available for AWS GovCloud regions. The availability of these AMIs improves the installation process because you are no longer required to upload a custom RHCOS AMI to deploy a cluster.
//For more information on installing to a AWS GovCloud region, <insert link to topic after it merges>

[id="ocp-4-10-installation-and-upgrade-tagrole"]
==== Using a custom AWS IAM role for instance profiles

Beginning with {product-title} {product-version}, if you configure a cluster with an existing IAM role, the installer no longer adds the `shared` tag to the role when deploying the cluster. This enhancement improves the installation process for organizations that want to use a custom IAM role, but whose security policies prevent the use of the `shared` tag.

[id="ocp-4-10-installation-vsphere-csi"]
==== CSI driver installation on vSphere clusters

To install a CSI driver on a cluster running on vSphere, you must have the following components installed:

* Virtual hardware version 15 or greater
* vSphere version 6.7 Update 3 or greater
* VMware ESXi version 6.7 Update 3 or greater

Components with versions lower than those above are still supported, but are deprecated. Support for them will be removed in a future version of {product-title}.

[NOTE]
====
If your cluster is deployed on vSphere, and the preceding components are lower than the version mentioned above, upgrading from {product-title} 4.9 to 4.10 on vSphere is supported, but no vSphere CSI driver will be installed. Bug fixes and other upgrades to 4.10 are still supported, however upgrading to 4.11 will be unavailable.
====

[id="ocp-4-10-conditional-updates"]
==== Conditional updates

{product-title} 4.10 adds support for consuming conditional update paths provided by the OpenShift Update Service.
Conditional update paths convey identified risks and the conditions under which those risks apply to clusters.
The Administrator perspective on the web console only offers recommended upgrade paths for which the cluster does not match known risks.
However, OpenShift CLI (`oc`) 4.10 or later can be used to display additional upgrade paths for {product-title} 4.10 clusters.
Associated risk information including supporting documentation references is displayed with the paths.
The administrator may review the referenced materials and choose to perform the supported, but no longer recommended, upgrade.

For more information, see xref:../updating/understanding-upgrade-channels-release.adoc#conditional-updates-overview_understanding-upgrade-channels-releases[Conditional updates] and xref:../updating/updating-cluster-cli.adoc#update-conditional-upgrade-pathupdating-cluster-cli[Updating along a conditional upgrade path].

[id="ocp-4-10-web-console"]
=== Web console

[id="pod-debug-mode-web-console"]
==== Running a pod in debug mode
With this update, you can now view debug terminals in the web console. When a pod has a container that is in a `CrashLoopBackOff` state, a debug pod can be launched. A terminal interface is displayed and can be used to debug the crash looping container.

* This feature can be accessed by the pod status pop-up window, which is accessed by clicking on the status of a pod, provides links to debug terminals for each crash looping container within that pod.
* You can also access this feature on the *Logs* tab of the pod details page. A debug terminal link is displayed above the log window when a crash looping container is selected.

Additionally, the pod status pop-up window now provides links to the *Logs* and *Events* tabs of the pod details page.

[id="web-console-customized-workload-notifications"]
==== Customized workload notifications
With this update, you can customize workload notifications on the *User Preferences* page. *User workload notifications* under the *Notifications* tab allows you to hide user workload notifications that appear on the *Cluster Overview* page or in your drawer.

[id="improved-quota-visibility-web-console"]
==== Improved quota visibility
With this update, non-admin users are now able to view their usage of the `AppliedClusterResourceQuota` on the *Project Overview*, *ResourceQuotas*, and *API Explorer* pages in order to determine the cluster-scoped quota available for use. Additionally, `AppliedClusterResourceQuota` details can now be found on the *Search* page.

[id="ocp-4-10-ibm-z"]
=== IBM Z and LinuxONE

With this release, IBM Z and LinuxONE are now compatible with {product-title} {product-version}. The installation can be performed with z/VM or {op-system-base} KVM. For installation instructions, see the following documentation:

[id="ocp-4-10-security"]
=== Security and compliance

[id="ocp-4-10-networking"]
=== Networking

[id="ocp-4-10-networking-dual-stack-api-change"]
==== Dual-stack services require that ipFamilyPolicy is specified

When you create a service that uses multiple IP address families, you must explicitly specify `ipFamilyPolicy: PreferDualStack` or `ipFamilyPolicy: RequireDualStack` in your Service object definition. This change breaks backwards compatibility with earlier releases of {product-title}.

For more information, see link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2045576[BZ#2045576].

[id="ocp-4-10-redfish-events"]
==== Low-latency Redfish hardware event delivery (Technology Preview)

{product-title} now provides a hardware event proxy that enables applications running on bare-metal clusters to respond quickly to Redfish hardware events, such as hardware changes and failures.

The hardware event proxy supports a publish-subscribe service that allows relevant applications to consume hardware events detected by Redfish. The proxy must be running on hardware that supports Redfish v1.8 and higher. An Operator manages the lifecycle of the `hw-event-proxy` container.

You can use a REST API to develop applications to consume and respond to events such as breaches of temperature thresholds, fan failure, disk loss, power outages, and memory failure. Reliable end-to-end messaging without persistent stores is based on the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP). The latency of the messaging service is in the 10 millisecond range.

[NOTE]
====
This feature is supported for single node OpenShift clusters only.
====

[id="ocp-4-10-networking-ovn-gateway-config"]
==== OVN-Kubernetes support for gateway configuration

The OVN-Kubernetes CNI network provider adds support for configuring how egress traffic is sent to the node gateway.
By default, egress traffic is processed in OVN to exit the cluster and traffic is not affected by specialized routes in the kernel routing table.

This enhancement adds a `gatewayConfig.routingViaHost` field.
With this update, the field can be set at runtime as a post-installation activity and when it is set to `true`, egress traffic is sent from pods to the host networking stack.
This update benefits highly-specialized installations and applications that rely on manually configured routes in the kernel routing table.

This enhancement has an interaction with the Open vSwitch hardware offloading feature.
With this update, when the `gatewayConfig.routingViaHost` field is set to `true`, you do not receive the performance benefits of the offloading because egress traffic is processed by the host networking stack.

For configuration information, see xref:../networking/cluster-network-operator.adoc#nw-operator-configuration-parameters-for-ovn-sdn_cluster-network-operator[Configuration for the OVN-Kubernetes CNI cluster network provider].

[id="ocp-4-10-networking-metrics"]
==== Enhancements to networking metrics

The following metrics are now available for clusters.
The metric names that start with `sdn_controller` are unique to the OpenShift SDN CNI network provider.
The metric names that start with `ovn` are unique to the OVN-Kubernetes CNI network provider:

* `network_attachment_definition_instances{networks="egress-router"}`
* `openshift_unidle_events_total`
* `ovn_controller_bfd_run`
* `ovn_controller_ct_zone_commit`
* `ovn_controller_flow_generation`
* `ovn_controller_flow_installation`
* `ovn_controller_if_status_mgr`
* `ovn_controller_if_status_mgr_run`
* `ovn_controller_if_status_mgr_update`
* `ovn_controller_integration_bridge_openflow_total`
* `ovn_controller_ofctrl_seqno_run`
* `ovn_controller_patch_run`
* `ovn_controller_pinctrl_run`
* `ovnkube_master_ipsec_enabled`
* `ovnkube_master_num_egress_firewall_rules`
* `ovnkube_master_num_egress_firewalls`
* `ovnkube_master_num_egress_ips`
* `ovnkube_master_pod_first_seen_lsp_created_duration_seconds`
* `ovnkube_master_pod_lsp_created_port_binding_duration_seconds`
* `ovnkube_master_pod_port_binding_chassis_port_binding_up_duration_seconds`
* `ovnkube_master_pod_port_binding_port_binding_chassis_duration_seconds`
* `sdn_controller_num_egress_firewall_rules`
* `sdn_controller_num_egress_firewalls`
* `sdn_controller_num_egress_ips`

The `ovnkube_master_resource_update_total` metric is removed for the 4.10 release.

[id="ocp-4-10-networkobservability-switch"]
==== Switching between YAML view and a web console form

* Previously, changes were not retained when switching between *YAML view* and *Form view* on the web console. Additionally, after switching to *YAML view*, you could not return to *Form view*. With this update, you can now easily switch between *YAML view* and *Form view* on the web console without losing changes.

[id="ocp-4-10-networkobservability-targeted-pods"]
==== Listing pods targeted by network policies
When using the network policy functionality in the {product-title} web console, the pods affected by a policy are listed. The list changes as the combined namespace and pod selectors in these policy sections are modified:

* Peer definition
* Rule definition
* Ingress
* Egress

The list of impacted pods includes only those pods accessible by the user.

[id="ocp-4-10-networking-must-gather-tcpdump"]
==== Enhancement to must-gather to simplify network tracing

The `oc adm must-gather` command is enhanced in a way that simplifies collecting network packet captures.

Previously, `oc adm must-gather` could start a single debug pod only.
With this enhancement, you can start a debug pod on multiple nodes at the same time.

You can use the enhancement to run packet captures on multiple nodes at the same time to simplify troubleshooting network communication issues.
A new `--node-selector` argument provides a way to identify which nodes you are collecting packet captures for.

For more information, see xref:../support/gathering-cluster-data.adoc#support-network-trace-methods_gathering-cluster-data[Network trace methods] and xref:../support/gathering-cluster-data.adoc#support-collecting-host-network-trace_gathering-cluster-data[Collecting a host network trace].

[id="ocp-4-10-egress-ip-support-public-clouds"]
=== Egress IP address support for clusters installed on public clouds

As a cluster administrator, you can associate one or more egress IP addresses with a namespace. An egress IP address ensures that a consistent source IP address is associated with traffic from a particular namespace that is leaving the cluster.

For the OVN-Kubernetes and OpenShift SDN cluster network providers, you can configure an egress IP address on the following public cloud providers:

* Amazon Web Services (AWS)
* Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
* Microsoft Azure

To learn more, refer to the respective documentation for your cluster network provider:

* OVN-Kubernetes: xref:../networking/ovn_kubernetes_network_provider/configuring-egress-ips-ovn.adoc#configuring-egress-ips-ovn[Configuring an egress IP address]
* OpenShift SDN: xref:../networking/openshift_sdn/assigning-egress-ips.adoc#egress-ips[Configuring egress IPs for a project]

[id="ocp-4-10-openshift-sdn-netpol-egress-policies"]
==== OpenShift SDN cluster network provider network policy support for egress policies and ipBlock except

If you use the OpenShift SDN cluster network provider, you can now use egress rules in network policy with `ipBlock` and `ipBlock.except`. You define egress policies in the `egress` array of the `NetworkPolicy` object.

For more information, refer to xref:../networking/network_policy/about-network-policy.adoc#about-network-policy[About network policy].

[id="ocp-4-10-ne-router-compression"]
==== Ingress Controller router compression
This enhancement adds the ability to configure global HTTP traffic compression on the HAProxy Ingress Controller for specific MIME types. This update enables gzip-compression of your ingress workloads when there are large amounts of compressible routed traffic.

For more information, see xref:../networking/ingress-operator.adoc#nw-configuring-router-compression_configuring-ingress[Using router compression].

[id="ocp-4-10-ne-coredns-customization"]
==== Support for CoreDNS customization
A cluster administrator can now configure DNS servers to allow DNS name resolution through the configured servers for the default domain. A DNS forwarding configuration can have both the default servers specified in the `/etc/resolv.conf` file and the upstream DNS servers.

For more information, see xref:../networking/dns-operator.adoc#nw-dns-forward_dns-operator[Using DNS forwarding].

[id="ocp-4-10-ne-syslog-maxlength"]
==== Support for configuring the maximum length of the syslog message in the Ingress Controller
You can now set the maximum length of the syslog message in the Ingress Controller to any value between 480 and 4096 bytes.

For more information, see xref:../networking/ingress-operator.adoc#nw-ingress-controller-configuration-parameters_configuring-ingress[Ingress Controller configuration parameters].

[id="ocp-4-10-networking-metallb"]
==== Enhancements to MetalLB load balancing

The following enhancements to MetalLB and the MetalLB Operator are included in this release:

* Support for Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is added.
* Support for Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) in combination with BGP is added.
* Support for IPv6 and dual-stack networking is added.
* Support for specifying a node selector on the `speaker` pods is added. You can now control which nodes are used for advertising load balancer service IP addresses. This enhancement applies to layer 2 mode and BGP mode.
* Validating web hooks are added to ensure that addresss pool and BGP peer custom resources are valid.
* The `v1alpha1` API version for the `AddressPool` and `MetalLB` custom resource definitions that were introduced in the 4.9 release are deprecated. Both custom resources are updated to the `v1beta1` API version.
* Support for speaker pod tolerations in the MetalLB custom resrouce definition is added.

For more information, see xref:../networking/metallb/about-metallb.adoc#about-metallb[About MetalLB and the MetalLB Operator].

==== Enhanced configuration drift detection

With this enhancement, the Machine Config Daemon (MCD) now checks nodes for configuration drift if a filesystem write event occurs for any of the files specified in the machine config and before a new machine config is applied, in addition to node bootup. Previously, the MCD checked for configuration drift only at node bootup. This change was made because node reboots do not occur frequently enough to avoid the problems caused by configuration drift until an administrator can correct the issue.

Configuration drift occurs when the on-disk state of a node differs from what is configured in the machine config. The Machine Config Operator (MCO) uses the MCD to check nodes for configuration drift and, if detected, sets that node and machine config pool (MCP) to `degraded`.

For more information on configuration drift, see xref:../post_installation_configuration/machine-configuration-tasks.adoc#machine-config-drift-detection_post-install-machine-configuration-tasks[Understanding configuration drift detection].

=== Insights Operator

[id="ocp-4-10-insights-operator-sca"]
==== Importing simple content access certificates

In {product-title} 4.10, Insights Operator now imports your simple content access certificates from {console-redhat-com} by default.

For more information, see xref:../support/remote_health_monitoring/insights-operator-simple-access.adoc[Importing simple content access certificates with Insights Operator].

[id="ocp-4-10-insights-operator-data-collection-enhancements"]
==== Insights Operator data collection enhancements

To reduce the amount of data sent to Red Hat, Insights Operator only gathers information when certain conditions are met. For example, Insights Operator only gathers the Alertmanager logs when Alertmanager fails to send alert notifications.


In {product-title} 4.10, the Insights Operator collects the following additional information:

* (Conditional) The logs from pods where the `KubePodCrashlooping` and `KubePodNotReady` alerts are firing
* (Conditional) The Alertmanager logs when the `AlertmanagerClusterFailedToSendAlerts` or `AlertmanagerFailedToSendAlerts` alerts are firing
* Silenced alerts from Alertmanager
* The node logs from the journal unit (kubelet)
* The `CostManagementMetricsConfig` from clusters with `costmanagement-metrics-operator` installed
* The time series database status from the monitoring stack Prometheus instance
* Additional information about the {product-title} scheduler

With this additional information, Red Hat improves {product-title} functionality and enhances Insights Advisor recommendations.

[id="ocp-4-10-auth"]
=== Authentication and authorization

[id="ocp-4-10-auth-sync-group-membership"]
==== Syncing group membership from OpenID Connect identity providers

This release introduces support for synchronizing group membership from an OpenID Connect provider to {product-title} upon user login. You can enable this by configuring the `groups` claim in the {product-title} OpenID Connect identity provider configuration.

For more information, see xref:../authentication/identity_providers/configuring-oidc-identity-provider.adoc#identity-provider-oidc-CR_configuring-oidc-identity-provider[Sample OpenID Connect CRs].

[id="ocp-4-10-oc-commands-obtain-credentials-from-podman-config"]
==== oc commands now obtain credentials from Podman configuration locations

Previously, `oc` commands that used the registry configuration, for example `oc registry login` or `oc image` commands, obtained credentials from Docker configuration locations. With {product-title} {product-version}, if a registry entry cannot be found in the default Docker configuration location, `oc` commands obtain the credentials from Podman configuration locations. You can set your preference to either `docker` or `podman` by using the `REGISTRY_AUTH_PREFERENCE` environment variable to prioritize the location.

Users also have the option to use the `REGISTRY_AUTH_FILE` environment variable, which serves as an alternative to the existing `--registry-config` CLI flag. The `REGISTRY_AUTH_FILE` environment variable is also compatible with `podman`.

[id="ocp-4-10-notable-technical-changes"]
== Notable technical changes

{product-title} {product-version} introduces the following notable technical changes.

// Note: use [discrete] for these sub-headings.

[discrete]
[id="ocp-4-10-TLS-subject-alternative-names-required"]
==== TLS X.509 certificates must have a Subject Alternative Name

X.509 certificates must have a properly set the Subject Alternative Name field.
If you update your cluster without this, you risk breaking your cluster or rendering it inaccessible.

In older versions of {product-title}, X.509 certificates worked without a Subject Alternative Name, so long as the Common Name field was set.
link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.6/release_notes/ocp-4-6-release-notes.html#ocp-4-6-tls-common-name[This behavior was removed in {product-title} 4.6].

In some cases, certificates without a Subject Alternative Name continued to work in {product-title} 4.6, 4.7, 4.8, and 4.9.
Because it uses Kubernetes 1.23, {product-title} 4.10 does not allow this under any circumstances.

[discrete]
[id="ocp-4-10-cluster-cloud-controller-manager-operator"]
==== Cloud controller managers for additional cloud providers

The Kubernetes community plans to deprecate the Kubernetes controller manager in favor of using cloud controller managers to interact with underlying cloud platforms. As a result, there is no plan to add Kubernetes controller manager support for any new cloud platforms. The IBM Cloud implementation that is added in this release of {product-title} uses cloud controller managers.

In addition, this release supports using cloud controller managers for Google Cloud Platform (GCP), VMware vSphere, and Alibaba Cloud as a link:https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview[Technology Preview].

To learn more about the cloud controller manager, see the link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/cloud-controller/[Kubernetes Cloud Controller Manager documentation].

To manage the cloud controller manager and cloud node manager deployments and lifecycles, use the Cluster Cloud Controller Manager Operator.

For more information, see the xref:../operators/operator-reference.adoc#cluster-cloud-controller-manager-operator_platform-operators-ref[Cluster Cloud Controller Manager Operator] entry in the _Platform Operators reference_.

[id="ocp-4-10-deprecated-removed-features"]

=== Deprecated features

[id="ocp-4-10-arch-deprecations"]
==== IBM POWER8, IBM z13 all models, LinuxONE Emperor, LinuxONE Rockhopper, and x86_64 v1 architectures will be deprecated

{op-system} functionality in IBM POWER8, IBM z13 all models, LinuxONE Emperor, LinuxONE Rockhopper, and x86_64 v1 CPU architectures will be deprecated in an upcoming release. Additional details for when support will discontinue for these architectures will be announced in a future release.

[NOTE]
====
AMD and Intel 64-bit architectures (x86-64-v2) will still be supported.
====

[id="ocp-4-10-docker-config-location-deprecation"]
==== Default Docker configuration location deprecation
Previously, `oc` commands that used a registry configuration would obtain credentials from the Docker configuration location, which was `~/.docker/config.json` by default. This has been deprecated and will be replaced by a Podman configuration location in a future version of {product-title}.

[id="ocp-4-10-empty-file-support-deprecation"]
==== Empty file and stdout support deprecation in oc registry login

Support for empty files using the `--registry-config` and `--to` flags in `oc registry login` has been deprecated. Support for `-` (standard output) has also been deprecated as an argument when using `oc registry login`. They will be removed in a future version of {product-title}.

* `oc adm config`
* `oc adm options`

[id="ocp-4-10-removed-scheduler-policy"]
==== Scheduler policy removed

Support for configuring a scheduler policy has been removed with this release. Use a xref:../nodes/scheduling/nodes-scheduler-profiles.adoc#nodes-scheduler-profiles[scheduler profile] instead to control how pods are scheduled onto nodes.

==== {op-system-base} 7 support for compute machines removed

Support for running {op-system-base-full} 7 compute machines in {product-title} has been removed. If you prefer using {op-system-base} compute machines, they must run on {op-system-base} 8.

You cannot upgrade {op-system-base} 7 compute machines to {op-system-base} 8. You must deploy new {op-system-base} 8 hosts, and the old {op-system-base} 7 hosts must be removed.

==== Cloud Compute

* Previously, editing a machine specification on {rh-openstack-first} would cause {product-title} to attempt to delete and recreate the machine. As a result, this caused an unrecoverable loss of the node it was hosting. With this fix, any edits made to the machine specification after creation are ignored. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1962066[*BZ#1962066*])

* Previously, the check to ensure that the AWS machine was not updated before requeueing was removed. Consequently, problems arose when the AWS machine's virtual machine had been removed, but its object was still available. In the event that this happened, the AWS machine would requeue in an infinite loop and could not be deleted or updated. This update restores the check that was used to ensure that the AWS machine was not updated before requeueing. As a result, machines no longer requeue if they have been updated. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2007802[*BZ#2007802*])

* Previously, modifying a selector changed the list of machines that a machine set observed. As a result, leaks could occur because the machine set lost track of machines it had already created. This update ensures that the selector is immutable once created. As a result, machine sets now lists the correct machines. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2005052[*BZ#2005052*])

* Previously, if a virtual machine template had snapshots, an incorrect disk size was picked due to an incorrect usage of the `linkedClone` operation. With this update, the default clone operation is changed to `fullClone` for all situations. `linkedClone` must now by specified by the user. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2001008[*BZ#2001008*])

* Previously, the custom resource definition (CRD) schema requirements did not allow numeric values. Consequently, marshaling errors occurred during upgrades. This update corrects the schema requirements to allow both string and numeric values. As a result, marshaling errors are no longer reported by the API server conversion. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1999425[*BZ#1999425*])

* Previously, if the Machine API Operator was moved, or the pods were deployed as a result of a name change, the `MachineNotYetDeleted` metric would reset for each monitored machine. This update changes the metric query to ignore the source pod label. As a result, the `MachineNotYetDeleted` metric now properly alerts in scenarios where the Machine API Operator pod has been renamed. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1986237[*BZ#1986237*])

* Previously, egress IPs on vSphere were picked up by the vSphere cloud provider within the kubelet. These were unexpected by the certificate signing requests (CSR) approver. Consequently, nodes with egress IPs would not have their CSR renewals approved. This update allows the CSR approver to account for egress IPs. As a result, nodes with egress IPs on vSphere SDN clusters now continue to function and have valid CSR renewals. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1860774[*BZ#1860774*])

[id="ocp-4-10-image-registry-bug-fixes"]
==== Image Registry

* Previously, the registry internally resolved `\docker.io` references into `\registry-1.docker.io` and used it to store credentials. As a result, credentials for `\docker.io` images could not be located. With this update, the `\registry-1.docker.io` hostname has been changed back to `\docker.io` when searching for credentials. As a result, the registry can correctly find credentials for `\docker.io images`. (https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2024859[*BZ#2024859*])

* Previously, the image pruner job did not retry upon failure. As a result, a single failure could degrade the Image Registry Operator until the next time it ran. With this fix, the temporary problems with the pruner do not degrade the Image Registry Operator. (https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2051692[*BZ#2051692*])

* Previously, the Image Registry Operator was modifying objects from the informer. As a result, these objects could be concurrently modified by the informer and cause race conditions. With this fix, controllers and informers have different copies of the object and do not have race conditions. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2028030[*BZ#2028030*])

* Previously, `TestAWSFinalizerDeleteS3Bucket` would fail because of an issue with the location of the configuration object in the Image Registry Operator. This update ensures that the configuration object is stored in the correct location. As a result, the Image Registry Operator no longer panics when running `TestAWSFinalizerDeleteS3Bucket`. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2048443[*BZ#2048443*])


[discrete]
[id="ocp-4-10-image-streams-bug-fixes"]
==== Image Streams

* Previously, the image policy admission plug-in did not recognize deployment configurations, notably that stateful sets could be updated. As a result, image stream references stayed unresolved in deployment configurations when the `resolve-names` annotation was used. Now, the plug-in is updated so that it resolves annotations in deployment configurations and stateful sets. As a result, image stream tags get resolved in created and edited deployment configurations. (https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2000216[*BZ#2000216*])

* Previously, when global pull secrets were updated, existing API server pod pull secrets were not updated. Now, the mount point for the pull secret is changed from the `/var/lib/kubelet/config.json` file to the `/var/lib/kubelet` directory. As a result, the updated pull secret now appears in existing API server pods. (https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1984592[*BZ#1984592*])

* Previously, RAM validation for {rh-openstack-first} checked for values using a wrong unit, and as a result the validation accepted flavors that did not meet minimum RAM requirements. With this fix, RAM validation now rejects flavors with insufficient RAM. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2009699[*BZ#2009699*])

* Previously, {product-title} master nodes were missing Ingress security group rules when they were schedulable and deployed on {rh-openstack}. As a result, {product-title} deployments on {rh-openstack} failed for compact clusters with no dedicated workers. This fix adds Ingress security group rules on {rh-openstack-first} when masters are schedulable. Now, you can deploy compact three-node clusters on {rh-openstack}.

==== Machine Config Operator

* Previously, a warning message sent by the `clone_slave_connection` function was incorrectly stored in a `new_uuid` variable, which is intended to store only the connection's UUID. As a result, `nmcli` commands that include the `new_uuid` variable were failing due to the incorrect value being stored in the `new_uuid` variable. With this fix, the `clone_slave_connection` function warning message is redirected to `stderr`. Now, `nmcli` commands that reference the `new_uuid` variable do not fail. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2022646[*BZ#2022646*])

* Previously, an old version of the Kubernetes client library was present in the `baremetal-runtimecfg` project. When a Virtual IP (VIP) failed, the client connections might not be closed in a timely manner. This could result in long delays for monitor containers that rely on talking to the API. This fix updates the client library. Now, connections are closed as expected on VIP failovers and the monitor containers do not hang for an excessive period of time. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1995021[*BZ#1995021*])

* Previously, in clusters that use Stateless Address AutoConfiguration (SLAAC), the Ironic `addr-gen-mode` parameter was not being persisted to the OVNKubernetes bridge. As a result, the IPv6 addresses could change when the bridge was created. This broke the cluster because node IP changes are unsupported. This fix persists the `addr-gen-mode` parameter when creating the bridge. The IP address is now consistent throughout the deployment process. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1990625[*BZ#1990625*])"

* Previously, if a machine config included a compressed file with the `spec.config.storage.files.contents.compression` parameter set to `gzip`, the Machine Config Daemon (MCD) incorrectly wrote the compressed file to disk without extracting it. With this fix, the MCD now extracts a compressed file when the compression parameter is set to `gzip`. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1970218[*BZ#1970218*])

* Previously, systemd units were cleaned up only when completely removed. As a result, systemd units could not be unmasked by using a machine config because the masks were not being removed unless the systemd unit was completely removed. With this fix, when you configure a systemd unit as `mask: true` in a machine config, any existing masks are removed. As a result, systemd units can be unmasked.

[discrete]
[id="ocp-4-10-management-console-bug-fixes"]
==== Management Console

* Previously, the *OperatorHub* category and card links did not include valid `href` attributes. Consequently, the *OperatorHub* cateogry and card links could not be opened in a new tab. This update adds valid `href` attributes to the *OperatorHub* category and card links. As a result, the *OperatorHub* and its card links can be opened in new tabs. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2013127[*BZ#2013127*])

* Previously, on the *Operand Details* page, a special case was created where the conditions table for the `status.conditions` property always rendered before all other tables. Consequently, the `status.conditions` table did not follow the ordering rules of descriptors, which caused unexpected behavior when users tried to change the order of the tables. This update removes the special case for `status.conditions` and only defaults to rendering it first if no descriptor is defined for that property. As a result, the table for `status.condition` is rendered according to descriptor ordering rules when a descriptor is defined on that property. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2014488[*BZ#2014488*])

* Previously, the *Resource Details* page metrics tab was exceeding the cluster-scoped Thanos endpoint. Consequently, users without authorization for this endpoint would receive a `401` response for all queries. With this update, the Thanos tenancy endpoints are updated, and redundant namespace query arguments are removed. As a result, users with the correct role-based access control (RBAC) permissions can now see data in the metrics tab of the *Resource Details* page. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2015806[*BZ#2015806*])

== Known issues

// TODO: This known issue should carry forward to 4.8 and beyond! This needs some SME/QE review before being updated for 4.9.
* In {product-title} 4.1, anonymous users could access discovery endpoints. Later releases revoked this access to reduce the possible attack surface for security exploits because some discovery endpoints are forwarded to aggregated API servers. However, unauthenticated access is preserved in upgraded clusters so that existing use cases are not broken.
+
If you are a cluster administrator for a cluster that has been upgraded from {product-title} 4.1 to 4.8, you can either revoke or continue to allow unauthenticated access. It is recommended to revoke unauthenticated access unless there is a specific need for it. If you do continue to allow unauthenticated access, be aware of the increased risks.
+
[WARNING]
====
If you have applications that rely on unauthenticated access, they might receive HTTP `403` errors if you revoke unauthenticated access.
====
+
Use the following script to revoke unauthenticated access to discovery endpoints:
+
[source,bash]
----
## Snippet to remove unauthenticated group from all the cluster role bindings
$ for clusterrolebinding in cluster-status-binding discovery system:basic-user system:discovery system:openshift:discovery ;
do
### Find the index of unauthenticated group in list of subjects
index=$(oc get clusterrolebinding ${clusterrolebinding} -o json | jq 'select(.subjects!=null) | .subjects | map(.name=="system:unauthenticated") | index(true)');
### Remove the element at index from subjects array
oc patch clusterrolebinding ${clusterrolebinding} --type=json --patch "[{'op': 'remove','path': '/subjects/$index'}]";
done
----
+
This script removes unauthenticated subjects from the following cluster role bindings:
+
--
** `cluster-status-binding`

// TODO: This known issue should carry forward to 4.9 and beyond!
* The `oc annotate` command does not work for LDAP group names that contain an equal sign (`=`), because the command uses the equal sign as a delimiter between the annotation name and value. As a workaround, use `oc patch` or `oc edit` to add the annotation. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1917280[*BZ#1917280*])

* The assignment of egress IP addresses to control plane nodes with the egress IP feature is not supported on a cluster provisioned on Amazon Web Services (AWS). (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2039656[*BZ#2039656*])

* Previously, there was a race condition between {rh-openstack-first} credentials secret creation and `kube-controller-manager` startup. As a result, {rh-openstack-first} cloud provider would not be configured with {rh-openstack} credentials and would break support when creating Octavia load balancers for `LoadBalancer` services. To work around this, you must restart the `kube-controller-manager` pods by deleting the pods manually from the manifests. When you use the workaround, the `kube-controller-manager` pods restart and {rh-openstack} credentials are properly configured. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2004542[*BZ#2004542*])

* The ability to delete operands from the web console using the `delete all operands` option is currently disabled. It will be re-enabled in a future version of {product-title}.
