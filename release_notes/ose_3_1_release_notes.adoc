*New Features and Enhancements*

.For Administrators:
* Docker version 1.8.2 is required. This contains the fix to let the *_/etc/groups_* file use supplementary groups.
* OpenShift now allows you to sync LDAP records with OpenShift, so that you can manage groups easily.
* You can now configure an F5 load-balancer for use with your OpenShift environment.
* Several persistent storage options are now available, such as Red Hat's Gluster and CEPH, AWS, and Google Compute Engine. Also, NFS storage is now supplemented by ISCSI- and Fibre Channel-based volumes.
* Several Middleware services are now available, such as JBoss DataGrid, and JBoss BRMS, as well as a supported JBoss Developer Studio and Eclipse plug-in.
* The job object type is now available, meaning that finite jobs can now be executed on the cluster.
* Multiple enhancements have been made to the installer:
** The installer tool now uses a container-based install.
** The ansible-based installer can now deploy active/active, highly-available clusters.
** An uninstaller is now available.
** You can now specify your own SA certificate during the install, so that application developers do not have to specify the OpenShift-generated CA to obtain secure connections.
* You can now provide your own certificate during the installation.
* The DNS name for service SRV discovery has changed. Services without search paths resulted in long loadtimes to resolve DNS. The change reduces loadtimes.
* Excessive amounts of events being stored in etcd can lead to excessive memory growth. You can now set the `*event-ttl*` parameter in the master host configuration file to a lower value (for example, `*15m*`) to prevent memory growth.
* You can now specify which port to send routes to. Any services that are pointing to multiple ports should have the `*spec.port.targetPort*` parameter on the pod set to the port.
* The `oc rsync` command is now available, which can copy local directories into a remote pod.
* Isolated projects can now be bound together using `oadm pod-network join-project`.
* New commands exist to validate master and node configuration files: `openshift ex validate master-config` and `openshift ex validate node-config`.
* You can now delete tags from an image stream using the `oc tag <tag_name> -d` command.

.For Developers:
* Using `*v1beta3*` in configuration files is no longer supported:
** The `*etcdStorageConfig.kubernetesStorageVersion*` and `*etcdStorageConfig.openShiftStorageVersion*` values in the master configuration file must be `*v1*`.
** You may also need to change the `*apiLevels*` field and remove `*v1beta3*`.
** `*v1beta3*` is no longer supported as an endpoint. `*/api/v1beta3*` and `*/osapi/v1beta3*` are now disabled.
* Multiple console enhancements:
** Extended resource information is now available on the web console.
** The ability to trigger a deployment and rollback from the console has been added.
** Logs for builds and pods are now displayed on the web console in real time.
** When enabled, the web console will now display pod metrics.
** You can now connect to a container via a remote shell connection when in the *Builds* tab.
* Elastisearch, Fluentd, and Kibana are now available for logging comsumption.
* The Heapster interface and metric datamodel can now be used with OpenShift.
* Jenkins:
** A Jenkins image is now available for deployment on OpenShift.
** Integration between Jenkins masters and Jenkins slaves running on OpenShift has improved.
* Eclipse integration is now available, allowing developers to debug applications from remote machines.
* The `oc build-logs <build_name>` command is now deprecated, and replaced by `oc logs build/<build_name>`.
* The `*spec.rollingParams.updatePercent*` field in deployment configurations has been replaced with `*maxUnavailable*` and `*maxSurge*`.
* Images can be edited to set fields such as `*labels*` or `*annotations*`.



*Bug Fixes*

* https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1264836[BZ 1264836]: Previously, the upgrade script used an incorrect image to upgrade the HAProxy router. The script now uses the right image.
* https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1264765[BZ 1264765] Previously, an upgrade would fail when a defined imagestream or template didn't exist. Now, the isntaller skips the incorrectly defined imagestream or template and continues with the upgrade.
* https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1274134[BZ 1274134]: When using the 'oc new-app' command with the '--insecure-registry' option, it would not set if the docker daemon was not running. The issue has been fixed.
* https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1273975[BZ 1273975]: Using the 'oc edit' command on Windows machines displayed errors with wrapping and file changes. These issue have now been fixed.
* https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1268891[BZ 1268891]: Previously, creating pods from the same image in the same service and deployment were not grouped into another service. Now, pods created with the same image run in the same service and deployment, grouped together.
* https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1267559[BZ 1267559]: Previously, using the 'oc export' command could produce an error, and the export would fail. This issue has been fixed upstream.
* https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1266981[BZ 1266981]: The recycler would previously fail if hidden files or directories would be present. This issue has been fixed.
* https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1268484[BZ 1268484]: Previously, when viewing a build to completion on the web console after deleting and recreating the same build, no build spinner would show. The issue has now been fixed.
* https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1269070[BZ 1269070]: You can now use custom self-signed certificates for the web console for specific hostnames.
* https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1264764[BZ 1264764]: Previously, the installer tool did not have a option to configure the deployment type. Now, you can run the '--deployment-type' option with the installer to select a type, otherwise the type set in the installer will be set.
* https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1273843[BZ 1273843]: There was an issue with the 'pip' command not being available in the newest OpenShift release. This issue has now been fixed.
* https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1274601[BZ 1274601]: Previously, using the 'oc exec' command was only available to be used on privileged containers. Now, users with permissions to create pods can use the 'oc exec' command to 'ssh' into privileged containers.
* https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1267670[BZ 1267670]: There was an issue with using the 'iptables' command with the '-w' option to make the 'iptables' command wait to acquire the xtables lock, causing some SDN initializations to fail. This issue has now been fixed.
