== Overview

OpenShift Enterprise by Red Hat is a Platform as a Service (PaaS) that provides
developers and IT organizations with a cloud application platform for deploying
new applications on secure, scalable resources with minimal configuration and
management overhead. OpenShift Enterprise supports a wide selection of
programming languages and frameworks, such as Java, Ruby, and PHP.

Built on Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Google Kubernetes, OpenShift Enterprise
provides a secure and scalable multi-tenant operating system for todayâ€™s
enterprise-class applications while providing integrated application runtimes
and libraries. OpenShift Enterprise brings the OpenShift PaaS platform to
customer data centers, enabling organizations to implement a private PaaS that
meets security, privacy, compliance, and governance requirements.

== New Features and Enhancements

OpenShift Enterprise version 3.1 is now available. Ensure that you follow the
instructions on upgrading your OpenShift cluster properly, including steps
specific to this release.

[IMPORTANT]
====
For any release, always review link:../install_config/upgrades.html[Installation
and Configuration] for instructions on
link:../install_config/upgrades.html[upgrading your OpenShift cluster] properly,
including any additional steps that may be required for a specific release.
====

.For Administrators:
* Docker version 1.8.2 is required. This contains the fix to let the
*_/etc/groups_* file use supplementary groups.
* OpenShift now allows you to sync LDAP records with OpenShift, so that you can
manage groups easily.
* You can now configure an F5 load-balancer for use with your OpenShift
environment.
* Several persistent storage options are now available, such as Red Hat's
GlusterFS and Ceph RBD, AWS, and Google Compute Engine. Also, NFS storage is
now supplemented by iSCSI- and Fibre Channel-based volumes.
* Several middleware services are now available, such as JBoss DataGrid, and
JBoss BRMS, as well as a supported JBoss Developer Studio and Eclipse plug-in.
* The job object type is now available, meaning that finite jobs can now be
executed on the cluster.
* Multiple enhancements have been made to the Ansible-based installation
utility. The utility can now:
** Perform container-based installations. (Technology Preview)
** Install active-active, highly-available clusters.
** Uninstall existing OpenShift clusters.
* You can now specify your own CA certificate during the install so that
application developers do not have to specify the OpenShift-generated CA to
obtain secure connections.
* The DNS name for service SRV discovery has changed. Services without search
* paths resulted in long load times to resolve DNS. The change reduces load
* times.
* Excessive amounts of events being stored in etcd can lead to excessive memory
growth. You can now set the `*event-ttl*` parameter in the master
configuration file to a lower value (for example, `*15m*`) to prevent memory
growth.
* You can now specify which port to send routes to. Any services that are
pointing to multiple ports should have the `*spec.port.targetPort*` parameter
on the pod set to the port.
* The `oc rsync` command is now available, which can copy local directories into
a remote pod.
* Isolated projects can now be bound together using `oadm pod-network
join-project`.
* New commands exist to validate master and node configuration files: `openshift
ex validate master-config` and `openshift ex validate node-config`.
* You can now delete tags from an image stream using the `oc tag <tag_name> -d`
command.

.For Developers:
* Using `*v1beta3*` in configuration files is no longer supported:
** The `*etcdStorageConfig.kubernetesStorageVersion*` and
`*etcdStorageConfig.openShiftStorageVersion*` values in the master
configuration file must be `*v1*`.
** You may also need to change the `*apiLevels*` field and remove `*v1beta3*`.
** `*v1beta3*` is no longer supported as an endpoint. `*/api/v1beta3*` and
`*/osapi/v1beta3*` are now disabled. * Multiple console enhancements:
** Extended resource information is now available on the web console.
** The ability to trigger a deployment and rollback from the console has been
added.
** Logs for builds and pods are now displayed on the web console in real time.
** When enabled, the web console will now display pod metrics.
** You can now connect to a container using a remote shell connection when in
the *Builds* tab.
* Elasticsearch, Fluentd, and Kibana are now available for logging consumption.
* The Heapster interface and metric datamodel can now be used with OpenShift.
* Jenkins:
** A Jenkins image is now available for deployment on OpenShift.
** Integration between Jenkins masters and Jenkins slaves running on OpenShift
has improved.
* Eclipse integration is now available, allowing developers to debug
applications from remote machines.
* The `oc build-logs <build_name>` command is now deprecated and replaced by `oc
logs build/<build_name>`.
* The `*spec.rollingParams.updatePercent*` field in deployment configurations
has been replaced with `*maxUnavailable*` and `*maxSurge*`.
* Images can be edited to set fields such as `*labels*` or `*annotations*`.

[[ose-31-bug-fixes]]

== Bug Fixes

* https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1264836[BZ 1264836]: Previously,
the upgrade script used an incorrect image to upgrade the HAProxy router. The
script now uses the right image.
* https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1264765[BZ 1264765] Previously, an
upgrade would fail when a defined image stream or template did not exist. Now,
the installation utility skips the incorrectly defined image stream or
template and continues with the upgrade.
* https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1274134[BZ 1274134]: When using
the `oc new-app` command with the `--insecure-registry` option, it would not
set if the Docker daemon was not running. The issue has been fixed.
* https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1273975[BZ 1273975]: Using the `oc
edit` command on Windows machines displayed errors with wrapping and file
changes. These issues have now been fixed.
* https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1268891[BZ 1268891]: Previously,
creating pods from the same image in the same service and deployment were not
grouped into another service. Now, pods created with the same image run in the
same service and deployment, grouped together.
* https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1267559[BZ 1267559]: Previously,
using the `oc export` command could produce an error, and the export would
fail. This issue has been fixed upstream.
* https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1266981[BZ 1266981]: The recycler
would previously fail if hidden files or directories would be present. This
issue has been fixed.
* https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1268484[BZ 1268484]: Previously,
when viewing a build to completion on the web console after deleting and
recreating the same build, no build spinner would show. The issue has now been
fixed.
* https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1269070[BZ 1269070]: You can now
use custom self-signed certificates for the web console for specific host
names.
* https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1264764[BZ 1264764]: Previously,
the installation utility did not have a option to configure the deployment
type. Now, you can run the `--deployment-type` option with the installation
utility to select a type, otherwise the type set in the installation utility
will be set.
* https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1273843[BZ 1273843]: There was an
issue with the `pip` command not being available in the newest OpenShift
release. This issue has now been fixed.
* https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1274601[BZ 1274601]: Previously,
using the `oc exec` command was only available to be used on privileged
containers. Now, users with permissions to create pods can use the `oc exec`
command to SSH into privileged containers.
* https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1267670[BZ 1267670]: There was an
issue with using the `iptables` command with the `-w` option to make the
`iptables` command wait to acquire the *xtables* lock, causing some SDN
initializations to fail. This issue has now been fixed.
