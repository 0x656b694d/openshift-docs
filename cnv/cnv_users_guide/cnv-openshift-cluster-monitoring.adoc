{product-title} provides various resources for monitoring at the cluster level.


.Cluster monitoring

{product-title} includes a pre-configured, pre-installed, and self-updating monitoring stack that is based on the link:https://prometheus.io/[Prometheus] open source project and its wider eco-system. It provides monitoring of cluster components and includes a set of alerts to immediately notify the cluster administrator about any occurring problems and a set of link:https://grafana.com/[Grafana] dashboards. The cluster monitoring stack is only supported for monitoring {product-title} clusters.

For more information on cluster monitoring, see the xref:../../monitoring/cluster-monitoring/about-cluster-monitoring.adoc#about-cluster-monitoring[{product-title} cluster monitoring] documentation.

.Cluster logging

The cluster logging components are based upon Elasticsearch, Fluentd, and Kibana (EFK).
The collector, link:http://www.fluentd.org/architecture[Fluentd], is deployed to each node in the {product-title} cluster.
It collects all node and container logs and writes them to link:https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch[Elasticsearch] (ES).
link:https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/introduction.html[Kibana] is the centralized, web UI
where users and administrators can create rich visualizations and dashboards with the aggregated data.

For more information on cluster logging, see the xref:../../logging/efk-logging.adoc#efk-logging[{product-title} cluster logging] documentation.

.Telemetry

Telemetry collects anonymized aggregated information about:

* The size of an {product-title} cluster
* The health and status of {product-title} components
* Use of {product-title} components
* The features in use

For more information on Telemetry, see the xref:../../telemetry/about-telemetry.adoc#about-telemetry[{product-title} Telemetry] documentation.

.CLI troubleshooting and debugging commands
