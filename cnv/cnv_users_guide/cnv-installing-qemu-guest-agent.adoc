The QEMU guest agent is a daemon that runs on the virtual machine. The agent 
passes network information on the virtual machine, notably the IP address of 
additional networks, to the host.

You can also install and start the QEMU guest agent using the 
*cloud-init*:*Use custom script* field of the wizard when creating either 
virtual machines or virtual machines templates in the web console.

For Windows virtual machines, the QEMU guest agent is included in the 
VirtIO drivers, which can be installed on
