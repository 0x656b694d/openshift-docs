On {product-title} 4 clusters, metering can be installed through OperatorHub. If you are using an earlier version of {product-title} or a Kubernetes cluster without OpenShift, use the link:https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-metering/tree/master/Documentation[upstream documentation] to install, configure, and use metering.

To get started installing metering, first install the Metering Operator from OperatorHub. Next, configure your instance of metering by creating a `CustomReosource`, referred to here as your `MeteringConfig`. The installation process creates a default `MeteringConfig` that you can modify using the examples in the documentation. After creating your `MeteringConfig`, install the metering stack. Last, verify your installation.
