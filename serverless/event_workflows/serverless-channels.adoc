Events can be sent from a source to a sink by using channels and subscriptions for event delivery.

// just sources or do we need to talk about other event producers?

Channels are custom resources that define a single event-forwarding and persistence layer.

After events have been sent to a channel, these events can be sent to multiple Knative services, or other sinks, by using a subscription.

The default configuration for channel instances is defined in the `default-ch-webhook` ConfigMap.
Developers can create their own channels directly by instantiating a supported `Channel` object.

== Supported channel types

Currently, {ServerlessProductName} only supports `InMemoryChannel` kind channels for development use, as part of the Knative Eventing Technology Preview.

The following are limitations of InMemoryChannel type channels:

* No event persistence is available. If a Pod goes down, events on that Pod are lost.
* InMemoryChannel type channels do not implement event ordering, so two events that are received in the channel at the same time can be delivered to a subscriber in any order.
* If a subscriber rejects an event, there are no re-delivery attempts. Instead, the rejected event is sent to a `deadLetterSink` if this sink exists, or is otherwise dropped.
