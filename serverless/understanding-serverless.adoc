Red Hat OpenShift Serverless is based on the open source Knative project, which provides portability and consistency across hybrid and multi-cloud environments by enabling an enterprise-grade serverless platform. It implements the building blocks for developers to create modern, source-centric, container-based applications through a series of Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) and associated controllers in Kubernetes.

Red Hat OpenShift Serverless simplifies the process of getting code from development into production by reducing the requirement for developer input in infrastructure set up or back-end development.
Developers on Red Hat OpenShift Serverless can use the provided Kubernetes-native APIs, as well as familiar languages and frameworks to deploy applications and container workloads.

Combining Operators, Knative and {product-title} enables stateful, stateless, and serverless workloads to all run on a single multi-cloud container platform with automated operations. Developers can benefit from being able to use a single platform for hosting their microservices, legacy, and serverless applications.
