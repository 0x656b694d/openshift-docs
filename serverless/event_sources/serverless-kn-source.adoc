toc::[]

You can use the `kn` CLI to list and manage available event sources or event source types for use with Knative Eventing.

Currently, `kn` supports management of the following event source types:

API server source:: Connects a sink to the Kubernetes API server by creating an `APIServerSource` object.
Ping source:: Periodically sends ping events with a constant payload. A ping source can be used as a timer, and is created as a `PingSource` object.
