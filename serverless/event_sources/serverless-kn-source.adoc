toc::[]

You can use the `kn` CLI to list and manage available event sources or event source types for use with Knative Eventing.

Currently, `kn` supports management of the following event source types:

ApiServerSource:: Connects a sink to the Kubernetes API server.
PingSource:: Periodically sends ping events with a constant payload. It can be used as a timer.

// Additional sources can be added by the cluster administrator. For example, {ServerlessProductName} can be used with Kafka and Camel K event sources, which are installed using the Operator Hub in the {product-title} web console.
// For more information about adding event source types as a cluster administrator, see
// xref:../knative-client.adoc#knative-client[Installing Knative Client].
