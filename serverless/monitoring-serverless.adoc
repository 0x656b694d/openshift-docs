As an {product-title} cluster administrator, you can deploy the {product-title} monitoring stack and monitor the metrics of Openshift Serverless components.

When using the OpenShift Serverless operator, the required ServiceMonitor objects are created automatically for monitoring the deployed components.

OpenShift Serverless components, such as Knative Serving, expose metrics data. Administrators can monitor this data by using the {product-title} web console.
