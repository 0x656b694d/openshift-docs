Red Hat OpenShift Serverless provides capabilities for automatic Pod scaling, including scaling inactive Pods to zero, by enabling the Knative Serving autoscaling system in an {product-title} cluster.

To enable autoscaling for Knative Serving, you must configure concurrency and scale bounds in the revision template.

[NOTE]
Any limits or targets set in the revision template are measured against a single instance of your application. For example, setting the `target` annotation to `50` will configure the autoscaler to scale the application so that each instance of it will handle 50 requests at a time.
