[role="_abstract"]
The {product-title} ({product-title-short}) dashboard enables you to visually track and analyze key metrics such as levels of risk in your environment, compliance status, policy violations, and common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVEs) in images. The dashboard helps you understand your cloud-native infrastructure, including images, containers, pods, namespaces, clusters, and their configurations.

[NOTE]
====
When you open the {product-title-short} portal for the first time, you might see a blank dashboard. After you deploy Sensor in at least one cluster, the dashboard reflects the status of your environment. 
====

The dashboard includes interactive widgets that provide different key performance indicators (KPIs) for violations, risk, vulnerabilities, and compliance.

[id="overview-data"]
== Overview data

The top of the dashboard shows an overview of system data, including the number of clusters, nodes, violations, deployments, images, and secrets. Choosing one of those items takes you to the main menu page for the selected item. For example, to view the *Configuration Management* -> *Deployments* page, select *Deployments*.

[id="select-resources"]
== Selecting resources used in widget data

You can review metrics for your entire system or only selected resources by selecting the following options:

* To view data for specific clusters, select the clusters from the *Resources* drop-down list. 
* To view data for all clusters, select *All clusters*. 
* To view data for specific namespaces, select them from the *Resources* drop-down list. Note that selecting a cluster automatically includes all namespaces that are a part of that cluster.  

[id="policy-violations-by-severity"]
== Policy violations by severity

The *Policy violations by severity* widget displays the total number of violations and displays the number of violations by severity level. Severity levels are color-coded with gray for low severity; yellow for medium severity; orange for high severity; and red for critical severity. 

You can select items to view additional information as follows:

* To view all violations of a specific severity, click the count for the desired severity level. 
* To view all violations of any severity, select *View all*. Choosing a violations category or *View all* displays the *Violations* page and the menu bar reflects any *Cluster* or *Namespace* selections that you made in the dashboard.

The *Policy violations by severity* widget also displays the three most recent violations that have a severity level of *Critical*. Choosing a specific violation displays the xref:../operating/respond-to-violations.adoc#view-violation-details[Violations detail] page that provides additional information about the violation.

[id="images-at-most-risk"]
== Images at most risk

The *Images at most risk* widget lists images that have the highest xref:../operating/evaluate-security-risks.adoc#risk-view-details_evaluate-security-risks[risk priority]. 

To configure which image vulnerabilities are displayed in the widget, select *Options* and perform one of the following actions:

*  To display the number of fixable CVEs in the *Critical CVEs* and *Important CVEs* columns, select *Fixable CVEs*.
*  To display the total number of CVEs in the *Critical CVEs* and *Important CVEs* columns, select *All CVEs*.

To configure which images are displayed in the widget by status, select *Options* and perform one of the following actions:

* To display xref:../operating/examine-images-for-vulnerabilities.adoc#periodic-scanning-of-images_examine-images-for-vulnerabilities[active images] at most risk, select *Active images*. 
* To display images at most risk, regardless of their active or inactive status, select *All images*. 

You can also perform the following actions in this widget:

* To view CVEs for an image, click on the image name.
* To view a list of all the images at most risk, select *View all*.

[id="deployments-at-most-risk"]
== Deployments at most risk

The *Deployments at most risk* widget lists deployments that have the highest risk, as determined by the risk priority. The widget displays the deployment name, resource location, and risk priority. 

You can perform the following actions in this widget:

* To view the *Risk* page for a deployment, click the deployment name. 
* To view the *Network Graph* page for the deployment, click the resource location. 
* To view all deployments at most risk, select *View all*.

[id="aging-images"]
== Aging images

The *Aging images* widget shows the active images by age, allowing you to understand how many images have not been updated for a selected period of time. 

The default view displays the number of images by age. The default values are 30-90 days, 90-180 days, 180-365 days, and greater than 365 days. Colors are assigned to each age category, with gray representing the newest images and red representing the oldest. 

To configure different beginning and ending values for the image age bar graph items in the widget, select *Options* and enter the desired values. Valid values are 1-365. To remove an age range item from the graph, clear any box.

For example, to view image counts by severity levels for 1-30, 30-60, and over 60 days, select *Options* and enter `1`, `30`, and `60` in the *Image age values* fields. Clear the last box so that the graph displays only three ranges. 

[id="policy-violations-by-category"]
== Policy violations by category

The *Policy violations by category* widget provides a graphical representation of violations by predefined policy categories such as vulnerability management, security best practices, and privileges. This widget displays a color-coded bar graph of violations by severity level. You can hover over the bar for each category to view the number of violations. Click on a severity level at the bottom of the graph to add or remove that level from the widget.  

To configure sorting for the widget display, select *Options* and perform one of the following actions:

* To sort by severity level, select *Severity*. Policy categories with the largest number of critical violations are displayed first. If more than one policy category has the same number of violations, the next highest severity level present is used in sorting. For example, if two policy categories have no critical violations, sorting is done by the next highest severity level that is present.  
* To sort by the total number of violations of any severity, select *Total*.

To configure the widget to display only violations that occur during a specific part of the policy life cycle, select *Options* and select *All*, *Deploy*, or *Runtime*.

[id="compliance"]
== Compliance by standard

The *Compliance* widget shows the status of various compliance benchmarks and the percentage of compliance coverage for each standard. Select *Options* to configure sorting by ascending or descending compliance percentage.  

[NOTE]
====
The *Compliance* widget shows details only after you run a compliance scan.
