[role="_abstract"]
{product-title} comes with role-based access control (RBAC) that you can use to configure roles and grant various levels of access to {product-title} to different users.
These roles govern access to {product-title} resources to prevent unwanted access.

* _Roles_ are a collection of rules, which are a group of `read` and `write` permissions that user can perform on a set of resources.
* _Resources_ are the functionalities of {product-title} for which you can set view (`read`) and modify (`write`) permissions.
See the Resource definitions section to understand the access level that each permission grants.
//TODO: Add link to Resource definitions
