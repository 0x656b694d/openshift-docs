== Overview
Depending on the underlying implementation, you can monitor a running
link:../architecture/core_objects/routing.html[router] in multiple ways. This
topic discusses the HAProxy template router, and the components to check to
ensure its health.

== Viewing Statistics
The HAProxy router exposes a web listener for the HAProxy statistics. Enter the
router's public IP address and the correctly configured port (1936 by default)
to view the statistics page, and enter the admin password when prompted. This
password and port were configured during the router installation, but can be
found by viewing the *_haproxy.conf_* file on the container.

== Viewing Logs
To view a router log, run the `oc log` command on the pod. Since the router is
running as a plug-in process that manages the underlying implementation, the log
is for the plug-in, not the actual HAProxy log.

== Router Internals
.Routes.json

Routes are processed by the HAProxy router, and are stored both in memory, on
disk, and in the HAProxy configuration file. The internal route representation,
which is passed to the template to generate the HAProxy configuration file, is
found in the *_/var/lib/containers/router/routes.json_* file. When
troubleshooting a routing issue, view this file to see the data being used to
drive configuration.

.HAProxy Config

You can find the HAProxy configuration and the back-ends that have been created
for specific routes in the *_/var/lib/haproxy/conf/haproxy.conf_* file. The
mapping files are found in the same directory. The helper front-end and
back-ends use mapping files when mapping incoming requests to a back-end.

.Certificates

Certificates are stored in two places. Certificates for edge terminated and
re-encrypt terminated routes are stored in the
*_/var/lib/containers/router/certs_* directory. Certificates that are used for
connecting to back-ends for re-encrypt terminated routes are stored in the
*_/var/lib/containers/router/cacerts_* directory. The files are keyed by the
namespace and name of the route. The key, certificate, and CA certificate are
concatenated into a single file. You can use
link:https://www.openssl.org/[OpenSSL] to view the contents of these files.

== Customizing a Router

The HAProxy router is based on a golang template.  This template generates the
HAProxy configuration file.  If you would like to customize a router to meet
your needs you are able to change the template file, build a new docker image,
and run a customized router.

One common case for this may be implementing new features withing the
application backends.  For instance, it might be desirable in a highly available
setup to use stick-tables that synchronizes between peers.  The router
plugin provides all the facilities necessary to make this customization.

.Using Stick Tables

*Adding a Peer Section*

In order to synchronize stick tables amongst peers you must a define a peers
section in your HAProxy configuration.  This section determines how HAProxy
will identify and connect to peers.  The plugin provides data to the template
under the `.PeerEndpoints` variable to allow you to easily identify members
of the router service.  You may add a peer section to the `haproxy-config.template`
by adding

[options="nowrap"]
----
{{ if (len .PeerEndpoints) gt 0 }}
peers openshift_peers
  {{ range $endpointID, $endpoint := .PeerEndpoints }}
    peer {{$endpoint.TargetName}} {{$endpoint.IP}}:1937
  {{ end }}
{{ end }}
----


*Changing the Reload Script*

When using stick tables you have the option of telling HAProxy what it should
consider the name of the local host in the peer section.  When creating endpoints the
plugin will attempt to set the `TargetName` to the value
of the endpoint's `TargetRef.Name`.  If `TargetRef` is not set it will set the
`TargetName` to the IP address.  Since the `TargetRef.Name` corresponds with the
Kubernetes host name you can add the `-L` option to the `reload-haproxy` script
to identify the local host in the peer section.

[options="nowrap"]
----
# Must match an endpoint target name that is used in the peer section
peer_name=$HOSTNAME

if [ -n "$old_pid" ]; then
  /usr/sbin/haproxy -f $config_file -p $pid_file -L $peer_name -sf $old_pid
else
  /usr/sbin/haproxy -f $config_file -p $pid_file -L $peer_name
fi
----

*Modifying Backends*

Finally, to use the stick tables within backends you may modify the HAProxy configuration
to use the stick-tables and peer set.  Below is an example of changing the existing
backend for TCP connections to use stick-tables.

[options="nowrap"]
----

            {{ if eq $cfg.TLSTermination "passthrough" }}
backend be_tcp_{{$cfgIdx}}
  balance leastconn
  timeout check 5000ms
  stick-table type ip size 1m expire 5m{{ if (len $.PeerEndpoints) gt 0 }} peers openshift_peers {{ end }}
  stick on src
                {{ range $endpointID, $endpoint := $serviceUnit.EndpointTable }}
  server {{$endpointID}} {{$endpoint.IP}}:{{$endpoint.Port}} check inter 5000ms
                {{ end }}
            {{ end }}
----

*Rebuilding Your Router*

Once you have made modifications to the router you must rebuild the docker image and push
it to your repository.  Then you may specify your new image when creating a router either
in the pod's spec directly or by using the `oadm` command

[options="nowrap"]
----
oadm router --credentials="$KUBECONFIG" --images=myrepo/myimage:mytag
