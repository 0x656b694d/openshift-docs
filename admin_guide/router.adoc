== Overview
Depending on the underlying implementation, you can monitor a running
link:../architecture/core_concepts/routes.html[router] in multiple ways. This
topic discusses the HAProxy template router and the components to check to
ensure its health.

== Viewing Statistics
The HAProxy router exposes a web listener for the HAProxy statistics. Enter the
router's public IP address and the correctly configured port (*1936* by default)
to view the statistics page, and enter the administrator password when prompted.
This password and port are configured during the router installation, but they
can be found by viewing the *_haproxy.conf_* file on the container.

== Viewing Logs
To view a router log, run the `oc log` command on the pod. Since the router is
running as a plug-in process that manages the underlying implementation, the log
is for the plug-in, not the actual HAProxy log.

== Viewing the Router Internals
*routes.json*

Routes are processed by the HAProxy router, and are stored both in memory, on
disk, and in the HAProxy configuration file. The internal route representation,
which is passed to the template to generate the HAProxy configuration file, is
found in the *_/var/lib/containers/router/routes.json_* file. When
troubleshooting a routing issue, view this file to see the data being used to
drive configuration.

*HAProxy configuration*

You can find the HAProxy configuration and the back- nds that have been created
for specific routes in the *_/var/lib/haproxy/conf/haproxy.conf_* file. The
mapping files are found in the same directory. The helper front end and back
ends use mapping files when mapping incoming requests to a back end.

*Certificates*

Certificates are stored in two places:

- Certificates for edge terminated and re-encrypt terminated routes are stored
in the *_/var/lib/containers/router/certs_* directory.
- Certificates that are used for connecting to back ends for re-encrypt
terminated routes are stored in the *_/var/lib/containers/router/cacerts_*
directory.

The files are keyed by the namespace and name of the route. The key,
certificate, and CA certificate are concatenated into a single file. You can use
link:https://www.openssl.org/[OpenSSL] to view the contents of these files.
