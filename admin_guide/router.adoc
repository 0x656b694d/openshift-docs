== Overview
Once you have a running link:../architecture/core_objects/routing.html[Router] you are ready
to monitor it.  Depending on the underlying router implementation this may be accomplished
multiple ways.  This document will discuss the HAProxy template router and the different
components that can be checked to ensure its health.

== Viewing Statistics
The HAProxy router exposes a web listener for the HAProxy statistics.  You can enter the public
IP address of the router with the correctly configured port to view the statistics page.  You 
will be prompted for the admin password.  This password and port were configured during the
router installation.

== Viewing Logs
To view a router log, simply run the `osc log` command for the pod.  Keep in mind that since
the router is running as a plugin process that manages the underlying implementation the log
that you will see is the log for the plugin, not the actual HAProxy log.  

== Router Internals
.Routes.json

As routes are processed by the HAProxy router they are stored both in memory, on disk, and in
the HAProxy configuration file.  In `/var/lib/containers/router/routes.json` you can find the
internal representation of the routes that is passed to the template to generate the HAProxy
configuration file.  When troubleshooting a route issue it may help to look at this file to
see the data that is being used to drive configuration.

.HAProxy Config

In `/var/lib/haproxy/conf/haproxy.conf` you can find the configuration that is being used
by HAProxy.  Here is where you can view the backends that have been created for specific routes.
Also, in the same directory you can find the mapping files that are used by the helper 
frontend and backends when mapping an incoming request to a backend.

.Certificates

Certificates are stored in two places. Certificates that are presented at the edge for edge
terminated and re-encrypt terminated routes are stored in `/var/lib/containers/router/certs/`.
Certificates that are used when connecting to backends for re-encrypt terminated routes are
stored in `/var/lib/containers/router/cacerts/`.  The files are keyed by the namespace and
name of the route.  You will find that the key, certificate, and CA certificate are 
concatenated into a single file.  You may use openssl to view the contents of these files.
