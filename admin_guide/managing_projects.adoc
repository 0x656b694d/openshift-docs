== Overview

In OpenShift, projects are used to isolate content from groups of developers. As an OpenShift administrator, you can give developers access to certain projects, allow them to create their own, and give them administrator rights.

[[selfprovisioning-projects]]

== Self-provisioning Projects

You can allow developers to create their own projects. There is an endpoint
that will provision a project according to a
xref:../dev_guide/templates.adoc#dev-guide-templates[template]. The web console and `oc new-project`
command use this endpoint when a developer xref:../dev_guide/projects.adoc#dev-guide-projects[creates a new project].

[[modifying-the-template-for-new-projects]]
=== Modifying the Template for New Projects
The API server automatically provisions projects based on the template that is
defined in the `projectRequestTemplate` parameter of the *_master-config.yaml_*
file. If the parameter is not defined, the API server creates a default template
that creates a project with the requested name, and assigns the requesting user
to the "admin" role for that project.

To create your own custom project template:

. Start with the current default project template:
+
----
$ oadm create-bootstrap-project-template -o yaml > template.yaml
----

. Modify the template by adding objects or modifying existing objects:
+
----
$ oc edit template template.yaml
----

. Load the template:
+
----
$ oc create -f template.yaml -n default
----

. Modify the *_master-config.yaml_* file to reference the loaded template:
+
====
----
...
projectConfig:
  projectRequestTemplate: "default/project-request"
  ...
----
====

When a project request is submitted, the API substitutes the following parameters into the template:

[cols="4,8",options="header"]
|===
|Parameter |Description

|*PROJECT_NAME*
|The name of the project. Required.

|*PROJECT_DISPLAYNAME*
|The display name of the project. May be empty.

|*PROJECT_DESCRIPTION*
|The description of the project. May be empty.

|*PROJECT_ADMIN_USER*
|The username of the administrating user.

|*PROJECT_REQUESTING_USER*
|The username of the requesting user.
|===

Access to the API is granted to developers with the
xref:../architecture/additional_concepts/authorization.adoc#roles[`self-provisioner`
role] and the `self-provisioners` cluster role binding. This role is available
to all authenticated developers by default.

[[disabling-self-provisioning]]
=== Disabling Self-provisioning

You can prevent an authenticated user group from self-provisioning new projects.

. Log in as a user with
xref:../architecture/additional_concepts/authorization.adoc#roles[*cluster-admin*]
privileges.
. Remove the `self-provisioners`
xref:../architecture/additional_concepts/authorization.adoc#roles[cluster role]
from the group.
+
----
$ oadm policy remove-cluster-role-from-group self-provisioner system:authenticated system:authenticated:oauth
----

. Set the `projectRequestMessage` parameter value in the
*_master-config.yaml_* file to instruct developers how to request a new
project. This parameter value is a string that will be presented to a user in
the web console and command line when the user attempts to self-provision a project.
You might use one of the following messages:
+
* To request a project, contact your system administrator at 
projectname@example.com.
* To request a new project, fill out the project request form located at
https://internal.example.com/openshift-project-request.

+
.Example YAML file
[source,yaml]
----
...
projectConfig:
  ProjectRequestMessage: "message"
  ...
----

. Edit the `self-provisioners` cluster role to prevent 
xref:../upgrading/manual_upgrades.adoc#updating-policy-definitions[automatic updates]
to the role. Automatic updates reset the cluster roles to the default state.
** To update the role from the command line:
... Run the following command:
+
----
$ oc edit clusterrole self-provisioner
----
... In the displayed role, set the `openshift.io/reconcile-protect` parameter
 value to `true`, as shown in the following example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: authorization.openshift.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  annotations:
    authorization.openshift.io/system-only: "true"
    openshift.io/description: A user that can request project.
    openshift.io/reconcile-protect: "true"
...
----

 ** To update the role by using automation, use the following command:
+
----
$ oc patch clusterrole self-provisioner -p '{ "metadata": { "annotations": { "openshift.io/reconcile-protect": "true" } } }'
----

[[using-node-selectors]]
== Using Node Selectors

Node selectors are used in conjunction with labeled nodes to control pod
placement.

[NOTE]
====
Labels can be assigned
xref:../install_config/install/advanced_install.adoc#configuring-node-host-labels[during
an advanced installation], or
xref:../admin_guide/manage_nodes.adoc#updating-labels-on-nodes[added to a node
after installation].
====

=== Setting the Cluster-wide Default Node Selector

As a cluster administrator, you can set the cluster-wide default node selector
to restrict pod placement to specific nodes.

Edit the master configuration file at *_/etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml_*
and add a value for a default node selector. This is applied to the pods created
in all projects without a specified `*nodeSelector*` value:

====
----
...
projectConfig:
  defaultNodeSelector: "type=user-node,region=east"
...
----
====

Restart the OpenShift service for the changes to take effect:

====
----
# systemctl restart atomic-openshift-master
----
====

=== Setting the Project-wide Node Selector

To create an individual project with a node selector, use the `--node-selector`
option when creating a project. For example, if you have an OpenShift topology
with multiple regions, you can use a node selector to restrict specific
OpenShift projects to only deploy pods onto nodes in a specific region.

The following creates a new project named `myproject` and dictates that pods be
deployed onto nodes labeled `user-node` and `east`:

====
----
$ oadm new-project myproject \
    --node-selector='type=user-node,region=east'
----
====

Once this command is run, this becomes the adminstrator-set node selector for
all pods contained in the specified project.

[NOTE]
====
While the `new-project` subcommand is available for both `oadm` and `oc`, the
cluster administrator and developer commands respectively, creating a new
project with a node selector is only available with the `oadm` command. The
`new-project` subcommand is not available to project developers when
self-provisioning projects.
====

Using the `oadm new-project` command adds an `annotation` section to the
project. You can edit a project, and change the `openshift.io/node-selector`
value to override the default:

====
----
...
metadata:
  annotations:
    openshift.io/node-selector: type=user-node,region=east
...
----
====

If `openshift.io/node-selector` is set to an empty string (`oadm new-project
--node-selector=""`), the project will not have an adminstrator-set node
selector, even if the cluster-wide default has been set. This means that, as a
cluster administrator, you can set a default to restrict developer projects to a
subset of nodes and still enable infrastructure or other projects to schedule
the entire cluster.

=== Developer-specified Node Selectors

OpenShift developers
xref:../dev_guide/deployments.adoc#assigning-pods-to-specific-nodes[can set a
node selector on their pod configuration] if they wish to restrict nodes even
further. This will be in addition to the project node selector, meaning that you
can still dictate node selector values for all projects that have a node
selector value.

For example, if a project has been created with the above annotation
(`openshift.io/node-selector: type=user-node,region=east`) and a developer sets
another node selector on a pod in that project, for example
`clearance=classified`, the pod will only ever be scheduled on nodes that have
all three labels (`type=user-node`, `region=east`, and `clearance=classified`).
If they set `region=west` on a pod, their pods would be demanding nodes with
labels `region=east` and `region=west`, which cannot work. The pods will never
be scheduled, because labels can only be set to one value.
