== Overview

As an OpenShift administrator, you may want to view the metrics from all
containers and components in one user interface. The
link:../architecture/infrastructure_components/kubernetes_infrastructure.html#kubelet[kubelet]
exposes metrics that can be collected and stored in various back ends by
link:https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/heapster[Heapster]. This guide uses
link:https://influxdb.com/[InfluxDB] for storage and
link:http://grafana.org[Grafana] for visualization.

[IMPORTANT]
====
This solution is a work in progress. As packaging improvements are made, these
instructions will be simplified.
====

== Node Configuration

In order for *Heapster* to retrieve metrics from the nodes, a read-only port has
to be opened on each node. This allows *Heapster* to retrieve metrics without
authentication.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Opening up the read-only port exposes information about the running pods (such
as namespace, pod name, labels, etc.) to unauthenticated clients. The
requirement to open up this read-only port will be fixed in future versions.
====

To enable the read-only port, you must configure the `*read-only-port*` Kubelet
argument in the *_node-config.yaml_* file on each node. Add the following to
your *_node-config.yaml_*:

====
[source,yaml]
----
kubeletArguments:
  "read-only-port":
    - "10255"
----
====

Restart your node to make this setting take effect.

== Deploying InfluxDB

Metrics are stored in *InfluxDB* for querying. This cluster is scalable using a
link:../architecture/core_concepts/deployments.html#replication-controllers[replication
controller], so you can link:../dev_guide/deployments.html#scaling[scale] the
*InfluxDB* cluster up and down as required.

The following is the manifest for the *InfluxDB* cluster:

====

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: "v1"
kind: "List"
items:
  -
    apiVersion: "v1"
    kind: "Service"
    metadata:
      labels:
        provider: "fabric8"
        component: "influxdb-monitoring"
      name: "influxdb-monitoring"
    spec:
      ports:
        -
          port: 8086
          targetPort: "http"
      selector:
        provider: "fabric8"
        component: "influxdb-monitoring"
  -
    apiVersion: "v1"
    kind: "ReplicationController"
    metadata:
      labels:
        provider: "fabric8"
        component: "influxdb-monitoring"
      name: "influxdb-monitoring"
    spec:
      replicas: 1
      selector:
        provider: "fabric8"
        component: "influxdb-monitoring"
      template:
        metadata:
          labels:
            provider: "fabric8"
            component: "influxdb-monitoring"
        spec:
          containers:
            -
              env:
                -
                  name: "PRE_CREATE_DB"
                  value: "k8s;grafana"
              image: "fabric8/influxdb:0.8.8"
              name: "influxdb"
              ports:
                -
                  containerPort: 8090
                  name: "raft"
                -
                  containerPort: 8099
                  name: "protobuf"
                -
                  containerPort: 8083
                  name: "admin"
                -
                  containerPort: 8086
                  name: "http"
              volumeMounts:
                -
                  mountPath: "/data"
                  name: "influxdb-data"
          volumes:
            -
              emptyDir:
              name: "influxdb-data"
----
====

Save this to a file and create it:

----
$ oc create -f <path/to/influxdb.yaml>
----

This starts a single *InfluxDB* instance. If you need to create a larger
cluster, you can scale the *InfluxDB* replication controller using:

----
$ oc scale rc influxdb-monitoring --replicas=<number>
----

== Deploying Heapster

*Heapster* reads all nodes and pods from the master, then connects to each
node's kubelet to retrieve pod metrics. *Heapster* will run under a
link:service_accounts.html[service account] with the *cluster-reader*
link:manage_authorization_policy.html#viewing-cluster-policy[cluster role] to
be able to retrieve these metrics.

The following is the definition of a service account for *Heapster* to use:

====
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: heapster
----
====

Save it to a file and create it with:

----
$ oc create -f <path/to/heapster-serviceaccount.yaml>
----

Add the *cluster-reader* role to the *Heapster* service account:

----
$ oadm policy add-cluster-role-to-user \
    cluster-reader \
    system:serviceaccount:default:heapster
----

The following is the definition of the *Heapster* replication controller:

====
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: "v1"
kind: "List"
items:
  -
    apiVersion: "v1"
    kind: "ReplicationController"
    metadata:
      labels:
        provider: "fabric8"
        component: "heapster"
      name: "heapster"
    spec:
      replicas: 1
      selector:
        provider: "fabric8"
        component: "heapster"
      template:
        metadata:
          labels:
            provider: "fabric8"
            component: "heapster"
        spec:
          containers:
            -
              args:
                - "-source=kubernetes:https://kubernetes.default.svc.cluster.local?auth=&insecure=true&useServiceAccount=true"
                - "-sink=influxdb:http://influxdb-monitoring.default.svc.cluster.local:8086"
              image: "kubernetes/heapster:V0.14.2"
              name: "heapster"
          serviceAccount: "heapster"
----
====

Save it to a file and create it with:

----
$ oc create -f <path/to/heapster.yaml>
----

== Deploying Grafana

*Grafana* allows users to create dashboards of metrics from *InfluxDB*. The
default installation comes with a basic dashboard, and users are encouraged to
create their own.

The following is the definition of the *Grafana* service and replication
controller:

====
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: "v1"
kind: "List"
items:
  -
    apiVersion: "v1"
    kind: "Service"
    metadata:
      labels:
        provider: "fabric8"
        component: "grafana"
      name: "grafana"
    spec:
      ports:
        -
          port: 80
          targetPort: "http"
      selector:
        provider: "fabric8"
        component: "grafana"
  -
    apiVersion: "v1"
    kind: "ReplicationController"
    metadata:
      labels:
        provider: "fabric8"
        component: "grafana"
      name: "grafana"
    spec:
      replicas: 1
      selector:
        provider: "fabric8"
        component: "grafana"
      template:
        metadata:
          labels:
            provider: "fabric8"
            component: "grafana"
        spec:
          containers:
            -
              env:
                -
                  name: "INFLUXDB_SERVICE_NAME"
                  value: "INFLUXDB_MONITORING"
                -
                  name: "GRAFANA_DEFAULT_DASHBOARD"
                  value: "/dashboard/file/kubernetes.json"
              image: "fabric8/grafana:1.9.1_2"
              name: "grafana"
              ports:
                -
                  containerPort: 3000
                  name: "http"
----
====

Save it to a file and create it with:

----
$ oc create -f <path/to/grafana.yaml>
