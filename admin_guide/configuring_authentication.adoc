== Overview
The OpenShift
link:../architecture/infrastructure_components/kubernetes_infrastructure.html#master[master]
includes a built-in
link:../architecture/additional_concepts/authentication.html#oauth[OAuth
server]. Developers and administrators obtain
link:../architecture/additional_concepts/authentication.html#api-authentication[OAuth
access tokens] to authenticate themselves to the API.

As an administrator, you can configure OAuth using a
link:master_node_configuration.html[master configuration file] to specify an
link:#identity-provider[identity provider]. When running a master without a
configuration file, the
link:#AllowAllPasswordIdentityProvider[`*AllowAllPasswordIdentityProvider*`]
identity provider is used by default, which allows any non-empty user name and
password to log in. This is useful for testing purposes.

To use other link:#identity-providers[identity providers], or to modify any
link:#token-options[token], link:#grant-options[grant], or
link:#session-options[session options], you must run the master from a
configuration file.

== Identity Providers
You can configure the master for authentication using your desired identity
provider by modifying the link:master_node_configuration.html[master
configuration file]. The following sections detail the identity providers
supported by OpenShift.

=== Allow All [[AllowAllPasswordIdentityProvider]]
Set `*AllowAllPasswordIdentityProvider*` in the `*identityProviders*` stanza to
allow any non-empty user name and password to log in. This is the default
identity provider when running OpenShift without a
link:master_node_configuration.html[master configuration file].

.Master Configuration Using `*AllowAllPasswordIdentityProvider*`
====

----
oauthConfig:
  ...
  identityProviders:
  - name: my_allow_provider <1>
    challenge: true <2>
    login: true <3>
    provider:
      apiVersion: v1
      kind: AllowAllPasswordIdentityProvider
----
<1> This provider name is prefixed to user names to form an identity name.
<2> When `true`, unauthenticated token requests from non-web clients (like
the CLI) are sent a `WWW-Authenticate` challenge header for this provider.
<3> When `true`, unauthenticated token requests from web clients (like the
Management Console) are redirected to a login page backed by this provider.
====

=== Deny All [[DenyAllPasswordIdentityProvider]]
Set `*DenyAllPasswordIdentityProvider*` in the `*identityProviders*` stanza to deny
access for all user name and passwords.

.Master Configuration Using `*DenyAllPasswordIdentityProvider*`
====

----
oauthConfig:
  ...
  identityProviders:
  - name: my_deny_provider <1>
    challenge: true <2>
    login: true <3>
    provider:
      apiVersion: v1
      kind: DenyAllPasswordIdentityProvider
----
<1> This provider name is prefixed to user names to form an identity name.
<2> When `true`, unauthenticated token requests from non-web clients (like the
CLI) are sent a `WWW-Authenticate` challenge header for this provider.
<3> When `true`, unauthenticated token requests from web clients (like the
Management Console) are redirected to a login page backed by this provider.
====

=== HTPasswd [[HTPasswdPasswordIdentityProvider]]

Set `*HTPasswdPasswordIdentityProvider*` in the `*identityProviders*` stanza to
validate user names and passwords against a flat file generated using
http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/programs/htpasswd.html[`htpasswd`].

Only MD5 and SHA encryption types are supported. MD5 encryption is recommended,
and is the default for `htpasswd`. Plaintext, crypt, and bcrypt hashes are not
currently supported.

The flat file is re-read if its modification time changes, without requiring a
server restart.

To create the file, run:

****
`$ htpasswd -c _</path/to/users.htpasswd>_ _<user_name>_`
****

To add or update a login to the file, run:

****
`$ htpasswd _</path/to/users.htpasswd>_ _<user_name>_`
****

To remove a login from the file, run:

****
`$ htpasswd _</path/to/users.htpasswd>_ -D _<user_name>_`
****

.Master Configuration Using `*HTPasswdPasswordIdentityProvider*`
====

----
oauthConfig:
  ...
  identityProviders:
  - name: my_htpasswd_provider <1>
    challenge: true <2>
    login: true <3>
    provider:
      apiVersion: v1
      kind: HTPasswdPasswordIdentityProvider
      file: /path/to/users.htpasswd <4>
----
<1> This provider name is prefixed to user names to form an identity name.
<2> When `true`, unauthenticated token requests from non-web clients (like the CLI) are sent a `WWW-Authenticate` challenge header for this provider.
<3> When `true`, unauthenticated token requests from web clients (like the Management Console) are redirected to a login page backed by this provider.
<4> File generated using http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/programs/htpasswd.html[`htpasswd`].
====

=== Basic Authentication (Remote) [[BasicAuthPasswordIdentityProvider]]

Set `*BasicAuthPasswordIdentityProvider*` in the `*identityProviders*` stanza to
validate user names and passwords against a remote server using a
server-to-server Basic authentication request. User names and passwords are
validated against a remote URL that is protected by Basic authentication and
returns JSON.

A `401` response indicates failed authentication.

A non-`200` status, or the presence of a non-empty "error" key, indicates an error:

----
{"error":"Error message"}
----

A `200` status with a `sub` (subject) key indicates success:

----
{"sub":"userid"} <1>
----
<1> The subject must be unique to the authenticated user and must not be able to be modified.

A successful response may optionally provide additional data, such as:

* A display name using the `name` key. For example:
+
----
{"sub":"userid", "name": "User Name", ...}
----
+
* An email address using the `email` key. For example:
+
----
{"sub":"userid", "email":"user@example.com", ...}
----
+
* A preferred user name using the `preferred_username` key. This is useful when the unique, unchangeable subject is a database key or UID, and a more human-readable name exists. This is used as a hint when provisioning the OpenShift user for the authenticated identity. For example:
+
----
{"sub":"014fbff9a07c", "preferred_username":"bob", ...}
----

.Master Configuration Using `*BasicAuthPasswordIdentityProvider*`

      kind: BasicAuthPasswordIdentityProvider
      url: https://www.example.com/remote-idp <4>
      ca: /path/to/ca.file <5>
      certFile: /path/to/client.crt <6>
      keyFile: /path/to/client.key <7>
----
<1> This provider name is prefixed to the returned user ID to form an identity name.
<2> When `true`, unauthenticated token requests from non-web clients (like the CLI) are sent a `WWW-Authenticate` challenge header for this provider.
<3> When `true`, unauthenticated token requests from web clients (like the Management Console) are redirected to a login page backed by this provider.
<4> URL accepting credentials in Basic authentication headers.
<5> Optional: Certificate bundle to use to validate server certificates for the configured URL.
<6> Optional: Client certificate to present when making requests to the configured URL.
<7> Key for the client certificate. Required if `*certFile*` is specified.
====

=== Request Header [[RequestHeaderIdentityProvider]]

Set `*RequestHeaderIdentityProvider*` in the `*identityProviders*` stanza to
identify users from request header values, such as `X-Remote-User`. It is
typically used in combination with an authenticating proxy, which sets the
request header value.

.Master Configuration Using `*RequestHeaderIdentityProvider*`
====

----
oauthConfig:
  ...
  identityProviders:
  - name: my_request_header_provider <1>
    challenge: false <2>
    login: false <3>
    provider:
      apiVersion: v1
      kind: RequestHeaderIdentityProvider
      clientCA: /path/to/client-ca.file <4>
      headers: <5>
      - X-Remote-User
      - SSO-User
----
<1> This provider name is prefixed to the user name in the request header to form an identity name.
<2> `*RequestHeaderIdentityProvider*` cannot be used to send `WWW-Authenticate` challenges.
<3> `*RequestHeaderIdentityProvider*` cannot be used to back a login page.
<4> Optional: PEM-encoded certificate bundle. If set, a valid client certificate must be presented and validated against the certificate authorities in the specified file before the request headers are checked for user names.
<5> Header names to check, in order, for user names. The first header containing a value is used as the user name. Required, case-insensitive.
====

=== GitHub [[GitHub]]

Set `*GitHubIdentityProvider*` in the `*identityProviders*` stanza to use
https://github.com/[GitHub] as an identity provider, using the
https://developer.github.com/v3/oauth/[OAuth integration].

NOTE: Using GitHub as an identity provider requires users to get a token using `_<master>_/oauth/token/request` to use with command-line tools.

.Master Configuration Using `*GitHubIdentityProvider*`
====

----
oauthConfig:
  ...
  identityProviders:
  - name: github <1>
    challenge: false <2>
    login: true <3>
    provider:
      apiVersion: v1
      kind: GitHubIdentityProvider
      clientID: ... <4>
      clientSecret: ... <5>
----
<1> This provider name is prefixed to the GitHub numeric user ID to form an identity name. It is also used to build the callback URL.
<2> `*GitHubIdentityProvider*` cannot be used to send `WWW-Authenticate` challenges.
<3> When `true`, unauthenticated token requests from web clients (like the Management Console) are redirected to GitHub to log in.
<4> The client ID of a link:https://github.com/settings/applications/new[registered GitHub OAuth application]. The application must be configured with a callback URL of `_<master>_/oauth2callback/_<identityProviderName>_`.
<5> The client secret issued by GitHub.
====

=== Google [[Google]]

Set `*GoogleIdentityProvider*` in the `*identityProviders*` stanza to use Google as
an identity provider, using
https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OpenIDConnect[Google's OpenID
Connect integration].

NOTE: Using Google as an identity provider requires users to get a token using
`_<master>_/oauth/token/request` to use with command-line tools.

.Master Configuration Using `*GoogleIdentityProvider*`
====

----
oauthConfig:
  ...
  identityProviders:
  - name: google <1>
    challenge: false <2>
    login: true <3>
    provider:
      apiVersion: v1
      kind: GoogleIdentityProvider
      clientID: ... <4>
      clientSecret: ... <5>
      hostedDomain: "" <6>
----
<1> This provider name is prefixed to the Google numeric user ID to form an identity name. It is also used to build the redirect URL.
<2> `*GoogleIdentityProvider*` cannot be used to send `WWW-Authenticate` challenges.
<3> When `true`, unauthenticated token requests from web clients (like the Management Console) are redirected to Google to log in.
<4> The client ID of a link:https://console.developers.google.com/[registered Google project]. The project must be configured with a redirect URI of `_<master>_/oauth2callback/_<identityProviderName>_`.
<5> The client secret issued by Google.
<6> Optional
link:https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OpenIDConnect#hd-param[hosted
domain] to restrict sign-in accounts to. If empty, any Google account is allowed
to authenticate.
====

=== OpenID Connect [[OpenID]]

Set `*OpenIDIdentityProvider*` in the `*identityProviders*` stanza to integrate with
an OpenID Connect identity provider using an
link:http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#CodeFlowAuth[Authorization Code Flow].

NOTE: *ID Token* and *UserInfo* decryptions are not supported.

By default, the `*openid*` scope is requested. If required, extra scopes can be
specified in the `*extraScopes*` field.

Claims are read from the JWT `id_token` returned from the OpenID identity
provider and, if specified, from the JSON returned by the `*UserInfo*` URL.

At least one claim must be configured to use as the user's identity. The
link:http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#StandardClaims[standard
identity claim] is `sub`.

You can also indicate which claims to use as the user's preferred user name,
display name, and email address. If multiple claims are specified, the first one
with a non-empty value is used. The
link:http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#StandardClaims[standard
claims] are:

[horizontal]
`sub`:: The user identity.
`preferred_username`:: The preferred user name when provisioning a user.
`email`:: Email address.
`name`:: Display name.

NOTE: Using an OpenID Connect identity provider requires users to get a token using `_<master>_/oauth/token/request` to use with command-line tools.

====

== Token Options

The OAuth server generates two kinds of tokens:

[horizontal]
Access tokens:: Longer-lived tokens that grant access to the API.
Authorize codes:: Short-lived tokens whose only use is to be exchanged for
an access token.

Use the `*tokenConfig*` stanza to set token options:

.Master Configuration Token Options
====

----
oauthConfig:
  ...
  tokenConfig:
    accessTokenMaxAgeSeconds: 86400 <1>
    authorizeTokenMaxAgeSeconds: 300 <2>
----
<1> Set `*accessTokenMaxAgeSeconds*` to control the lifetime of access tokens.
The default lifetime is 24 hours.
<2> Set `*authorizeTokenMaxAgeSeconds*` to control the lifetime of authorize
codes. The default lifetime is five minutes.
====

== Grant Options

To configure how the OAuth server responds to token requests for a client the
user has not previously granted permission, set the `*method*` value in the
`*grantConfig*` stanza. Valid values for `*method*` are:

[horizontal]
`auto`:: Auto-approve the grant and retry the request.
`prompt`:: Prompt the user to approve or deny the grant.
`deny`:: Auto-deny the grant and return a failure error to the client.

.Master Configuration Grant Options
====

----
oauthConfig:
  ...
  grantConfig:
    method: auto
----
====

== Session Options

The OAuth server uses a signed and encrypted cookie-based session during login
and redirect flows.

Use the `*sessionConfig*` stanza to set session options:

.Master Configuration Session Options
====

----
oauthConfig:
  ...
  sessionConfig:
    sessionMaxAgeSeconds: 300 <1>
    sessionName: ssn <2>
    sessionSecretsFile: "..." <3>
----
<1> Controls the maximum age of a session; sessions auto-expire once a token request is complete. If link:#grant-options[auto-grant] is not enabled, sessions must last as long as the user is expected to take to approve or reject a client authorization request.
<2> Name of the cookie used to store the session.
<3> File name containing serialized `*SessionSecrets*` object. If empty, a random signing and encryption secret is generated at each server start.
====

If no `*sessionSecretsFile*` is specified, a random signing and encryption
secret is generated at each start of the master server. This means that any
logins in progress will have their sessions invalidated if the master is
restarted. It also means that if multiple masters are configured, they will not
be able to decode sessions generated by one of the other masters.

To specify the signing and encryption secret to use, specify a
`*sessionSecretsFile*`. This allows you separate secret values from the
configuration file and keep the configuration file distributable, for example
for debugging purposes.

Multiple secrets can be specified in the `*sessionSecretsFile*` to enable
rotation. New sessions are signed and encrypted using the first secret in the
list. Existing sessions are decrypted and authenticated by each secret until one
succeeds.

.Session Secret Configuration:
====

----
apiVersion: v1
kind: SessionSecrets
secrets: <1>
- authentication: "..." <2>
  encryption: "..." <3>
- authentication: "..."
  encryption: "..."
...
----
<1> List of secrets used to authenticate and encrypt cookie sessions. At least one secret must be specified. Each secret must set an authentication and encryption secret.
<2> Signing secret, used to authenticate sessions using HMAC. Recommended to use a secret with 32 or 64 bytes.
<3> Encrypting secret, used to encrypt sessions. Must be 16, 24, or 32 characters long, to select AES-128, AES-192, or AES-256.
====
