== Overview
In some cases, it is desirable to allow users to create projects for themselves without administrator intervention.  To make this simpler, a user accessible endpoint is present that will provision a project according to a template.  This endpoint is made accessible via: `osc new-project <project-name>`.

== Configuration
=== New project template
The API server creates new auto-provisioned projects based on a template that it finds based on the `projectRequestTemplate` property of the master-config.yaml.  The property is in the form "namespace/templatename", by default "openshift/project-request".  If the template does not exist, the API server will create a default template that creates a project with the requested name and assigns the requesting user to the "admin" role for that project.  If the property is empty, then no action is taken and self-provisioning will fail.

If you want to change the way the shape of self-provisioned projects, you can change the template.  The API will substitute the following parameters into the template:

 .  PROJECT_NAME - name of the project

 .  PROJECT_DISPLAYNAME = display name of the project (defaults to PROJECT_NAME)

 .  PROJECT_DESCRIPTION = description of the project (defaults to PROJECT_DISPLAYNAME)

 .  PROJECT_ADMIN_USER = name of the requesting user



=== Permissions
Access to this API is granted via the `self-provisioner` role and the `self-provisioners` cluster role binding.  By default, it is available to all authenticated users.  

=== Disabling auto-provisioning
Deleting the `self-provisioners` cluster role binding will deny permissions for auto-provisioning new projects.  If you remove this permission, you should consider setting the `projectRequestMessage` option inside of the master-config.yaml file with instructions for how users can request a project.  That field is a string that will be presented to user in the webui and the cli when they attempt to self-provision a project.  Some common examples are:

 .  Call Bob at (555) 867-5309 to request a project

 .  Fill out the project request form located at https://internal.example.com/openshift-project-request
