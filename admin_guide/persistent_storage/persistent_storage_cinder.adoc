== Overview
You can provision your OpenShift cluster with
link:../../architecture/additional_concepts/storage.html[persistent storage] using
https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-enterprise-linux-openstack-platform/version-7/red-hat-enterprise-linux-openstack-platform-7-architecture-guide/chapter-1-components#comp-cinder[OpenStack Cinder].
Some familiarity with Kubernetes and OpenStack is assumed.

[NOTE]
====
OpenShift needs to be properly configured for OpenStack, see chapter
link:../configuring_openstack.html[Configuring OpenShift on OpenStack]
.
====

The Kubernetes link:../../dev_guide/persistent_volumes.html[persistent volume]
framework allows administrators to provision a cluster with persistent storage
and gives users a way to request those resources without having any knowledge of
the underlying infrastructure.

For a detailed example, see the guide for
https://github.com/openshift/origin/tree/master/examples/wordpress[WordPress and
MySQL using persistent volumes].

[IMPORTANT]
====
High-availability of storage in the infrastructure is left to the underlying
storage provider.

[[provisioning]]

== Provisioning
Storage must exist in the underlying infrastructure before it can be mounted as
a volume in OpenShift. All that is required for Cinder is a Cinder volume ID and
the `*PersistentVolume*` API.

    },
  }

[[volume-format]]

=== Volume Format
Before OpenShift mounts the volume and passes it to a container, it checks that
it contains a filesystem specified with `*fsType*` parameter. If the device is
not formatted with the filesystem, all data from the device are erased and the
device is automatically formatted with the given filesystem.

This allows using unformatted Cinder volumes as persistent volumes, as OpenShift
will format them before the first use. However, it can result in data loss if
value of `*fsType*` parameter is changed after the volume was already formatted
and provisioned with data.
