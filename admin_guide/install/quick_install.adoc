The _quick installation_ method allows you to use an interactive CLI utility to
install OpenShift across a set of hosts. The utility is a Python wrapper around
the Ansible-based installation method currently described in the
link:https://github.com/openshift/training[OpenShift Enterprise 3 Beta training
materials].

[NOTE]
====
The installation utility is under active development and will be similar in
function to the OpenShift v2 utility described at https://install.openshift.com.
This topic will be updated with more information on the utility for OpenShift v3
as development continues.
====

Alternatively, you can use the link:manual_install.html[manual installation]
method for step by step instructions on installing each component on individual
hosts.
