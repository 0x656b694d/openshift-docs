== Overview
For environments where a more manual approach than the interactive
link:quick_install.html[quick installation] method is required or desired, the
_manual installation_ method is available for installing OpenShift on your hosts
using http://www.ansible.com[Ansible] playbooks directly.

[NOTE]
====
The manual installation method is under active development.
====

ifdef::openshift-origin[]
Currently, this method is only available for OpenShift Enterprise 3 Beta, but
will support OpenShift Origin in a later release. See the
http://docs.openshift.com/enterprise/latest/admin_guide/install/manual_install.html[OpenShift
Enterprise documentation] for more information. Full OpenShift Enterprise 3 Beta
training materials are also available https://github.com/openshift/training[on
GitHub].
endif::[]

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
To install OpenShift Enterprise 3 Beta, consult your Red Hat account
representative for more details on gaining access to the appropriate
repositories. Full OpenShift Enterprise 3 Beta training materials are available
https://github.com/openshift/training[on GitHub].

== Prerequisites

[[default-hosts]]
These instructions assume the following default host configuration:

.Default Host Configuration
[options="header"]
|===

|Host Name |Infrastructure Component to Install

|*ose3-master.example.com*
|link:../../architecture/infrastructure_components/kubernetes_infrastructure.html#master[Master]
and
link:../../architecture/infrastructure_components/kubernetes_infrastructure.html#node[node]

|*ose3-node1.example.com*
|Node

|*ose3-node2.example.com*
|Node
|===

Modify the domain and host names in the following instructions as needed for
your environment.

Before installing OpenShift, you must first link:setup.html[set up your hosts],
which includes verifying system and environment requirements and properly
installing and configuring Docker. After following the instructions in the
link:setup.html[Setup] topic, you can continue to
link:#installing-ansible[installing Ansible].

== Installing Ansible [[installing-ansible]]
OpenShift's installation process is based on Ansible playbooks. The manual
installation method requires invoking Ansible directly. Ansible is currently
available in the EPEL repository.

Install the EPEL repository:

====
[options="nowrap"]
----
# yum -y install http://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/7/x86_64/e/epel-release-7-5.noarch.rpm
----
====

Disable the EPEL repository so that it is not accidentally used during later
steps of the installation:

====
[options="nowrap"]
----
# sed -i -e "s/^enabled=1/enabled=0/" /etc/yum.repos.d/epel.repo
----
====

Install the packages for Ansible:

====
----
# yum -y --enablerepo=epel install ansible
----
====

== Generating and Distributing SSH Keys
Ansible requires SSH key distribution. First, generate an SSH key on your
master, where we will run Ansible:

====
----
# ssh-keygen
----
====

Do *not* use a password.

An easy way to distribute your SSH keys is by using a `bash` loop:

====
[options="nowrap"]
----
# for host in ose3-master.example.com \
    ose3-node1.example.com \
    ose3-node2.example.com; \
    do ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub $host; \
    done
----
====

Modify the host names in the above command accordingly per your configuration.

== Cloning the Ansible Repository
The configuration files for the Ansible installer are currently available
https://github.com/detiber/openshift-ansible/tree/v3-beta4[on Github]. Clone the
repository:

====
[options="nowrap"]
----
# cd
# git clone https://github.com/detiber/openshift-ansible.git -b v3-beta4
# cd ~/openshift-ansible
----
====

== Configuring Ansible
Copy the Ansible configuration files to the *_/etc/ansible_* directory:

====
[options="nowrap"]
----
# /bin/cp -r ~/training/beta4/ansible/* /etc/ansible/
----
====

As mentioned in the link:#default-hosts[default host configuration], by default
Ansible installs and configures both the master and node components on the
*ose3-master.example.com* host. In the *_/etc/ansible/hosts_* file, you can see
this host present in both the *[masters]* and *[nodes]* sections:

====
[options="nowrap"]
----
# host group for masters
[masters]
ose3-master.example.com

# host group for nodes, includes region info
[nodes]
ose3-master.example.com openshift_node_labels="{'region': 'infra', 'zone': 'default'}"
ose3-node1.example.com openshift_node_labels="{'region': 'primary', 'zone': 'east'}"
ose3-node2.example.com openshift_node_labels="{'region': 'primary', 'zone': 'west'}"
----
====

If you are not using the *example.com* domain
and these host names, modify these sections and any other relevant sections of
the *_/etc/ansible/hosts_* file accordingly at this time.

== Running the Ansible Installer

You can now run the Ansible installer:

====
[options="nowrap"]
----
# ansible-playbook ~/openshift-ansible/playbooks/byo/config.yml
----
====

After the installer completes, you can verify that the master is started and
nodes are registered and reporting in *Ready* status by running the following as
*root*:

====
[options="nowrap"]
----
# osc get nodes

NAME                      LABELS                                                                     STATUS
ose3-master.example.com   kubernetes.io/hostname=ose3-master.example.com,region=infra,zone=default   Ready
ose3-node1.example.com    kubernetes.io/hostname=ose3-node1.example.com,region=primary,zone=east     Ready
ose3-node2.example.com    kubernetes.io/hostname=ose3-node2.example.com,region=primary,zone=west     Ready
----
====

== What's Next?

Now that you have a working OpenShift instance, you can:

- Deploy an link:../docker_registry.html[integrated Docker registry].
- Deploy a link:../../architecture/core_objects/routing.html#routers[router].
- Configure link:../configuring_authentication.html[authentication].
