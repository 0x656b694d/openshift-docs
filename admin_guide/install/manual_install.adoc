For environments where a more customized approach than the
link:quick_install.html[quick installation] method may be required, the _manual installation_ method allows you to install OpenShift step by step on
individual hosts.

////
This method describes a typical installation with Red Hat
Enterprise Linux Server 7.1 or greater as the underlying platform. Some of the
configuration settings described must be modified to suit your requirements.
////

[NOTE]
====
The manual installation method is under active development.

consult your Red Hat account representative for more details on gaining access
to the appropriate repositories, then see the

materials] for further instructions.
