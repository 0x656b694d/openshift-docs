OpenShift
link:../../architecture/infrastructure_components/kubernetes_infrastructure.html[infrastructure
components] can be installed across multiple hosts. The following sections
outline the system requirements and instructions for preparing your environment
and hosts before installing OpenShift. During the Beta phase, we recommend
installing a
link:../../architecture/infrastructure_components/kubernetes_infrastructure.html#master[master]
on one host, and two
link:../../architecture/infrastructure_components/kubernetes_infrastructure.html#node[nodes]
on two separate hosts.

*Security Warning*

OpenShift runs Docker containers on your hosts, and in some cases, such as build
operations and the registry service, it does so using privileged containers.
Furthermore, those containers access your host's Docker daemon and perform
`docker build` and `docker push` operations. As such, you should be aware of the
inherent security risks associated with performing `docker run` operations on
arbitrary images as they effectively have root access.

For more information, see these articles:

- http://opensource.com/business/14/7/docker-security-selinux
- https://docs.docker.com/articles/security/

OpenShift will increase the security constraints on containers in later beta
releases.

== Environment Requirements
*DNS*

A wildcard for a DNS zone must ultimately resolve to the IP address of the
OpenShift link:../../architecture/core_objects/routing.html[router].

For example, if you later use the default link:manual_install.html[manual
installation] method, you could ensure that the router ends up on the master. In
this case, create a wildcard DNS entry for *cloudapps*, or something similar,
that has a low TTL and points to the public IP address of the master:

----
*.cloudapps.example.com. 300 IN  A 192.168.133.2
----

In almost all cases, when referencing VMs you must use host names, and the host
names that you use must match the output of the `hostname -f` command on each
node. By extension, you must at least have all host name and IP mappings in
[filename]#/etc/hosts# files or forward DNS should work.

*Networking*

A shared network must exist between the master and node hosts.

*Git*

You must have either Internet access and a GitHub account, or read and write access to an internal, HTTP-based Git server.

== Host Preparation
Before installing OpenShift, you must first prepare each host per the following.

ifdef::openshift-origin[]
[NOTE]
====
If you are using https://www.vagrantup.com[Vagrant] to run OpenShift Origin, you
can do not need to go through the following sections. These changes are only
necessary when you are setting up the host yourself. If you are using Vagrant,
see the
https://github.com/openshift/origin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.adoc#develop-on-virtual-machine-using-vagrant[Contributing
Guide], then you can skip directly to trying out the
link:../../getting_started/administrators.html#try-it-out[sample applications].
====
endif::[]

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
*Installing Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7*

A base installation of Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 7.1 is required for
master or node hosts. See the
https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/7/html/Installation_Guide/index.html[Red
Hat Enterprise Linux 7.1 Installation Guide] for more information.

*Registering the Hosts*

Each host must be registered using Red Hat Subscription Manager (RHSM) and have
an active RHEL subscription attached to access the required packages.

[IMPORTANT]
====
To install OpenShift Enterprise 3 Beta, consult your Red Hat account
representative for more details on gaining access to the appropriate
repositories. Full OpenShift Enterprise 3 Beta training materials are available
https://github.com/openshift/training[on GitHub].
====

. On each host, register with RHSM:
+
----
# subscription-manager register --username=<user_name> --password=<password>
----

. List the available subscriptions:
+
----
# subscription-manager list --available
----

. In the output for the previous command, find the pool ID for an OpenShift
Enterprise subscription and attach it:
+
----
# subscription-manager attach --pool=<pool_id>
----

. Disable all repositories and enable only the required ones:
+
----
# subscription-manager repos --disable="*"
# subscription-manager repos \
--enable="rhel-7-server-rpms" \
--enable="rhel-7-server-extras-rpms" \
--enable="rhel-7-server-optional-rpms" \
--enable="rhel-7-server-ose-3.0-rpms"
----
endif::[]

*Managing Base Packages*

. Remove *NetworkManager*:
+
----
# yum remove NetworkManager*
----

. Install the following packages:
+
[options="nowrap"]
----
# yum install wget git net-tools bind-utils iptables-services bridge-utils
----

. Update the system to the latest packages:
+
----
# yum update
----

*Installing Docker*

Docker version 1.6 or later must be installed and running on master and node
hosts before installing OpenShift.

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
. In RHEL 7, Docker is provided in the RHEL Extras repository; first, ensure the
RHEL Extras repository is enabled:
+
----
# subscription-manager repos --enable=rhel-7-server-extras-rpms
----
endif::[]

. Install Docker:
+
----
# yum install docker
----

. Edit the *_/etc/sysconfig/docker_* file and add `--insecure-registry
172.30.0.0/16` to the `*OPTIONS*` parameter. For example:
+
----
OPTIONS=--selinux-enabled --insecure-registry 172.30.0.0/16
----
+
The `--insecure-registry` option instructs the Docker daemon to trust any Docker
registry on the *172.30.0.0/16* subnet, rather than requiring a certificate.

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
*Configuring Docker Storage*

Docker's default loopback storage mechanism is not supported for production use
and is only appropriate for proof of concept environments. For production
environments, you must create a thin-pool logical volume and re-configure docker
to use that volume.

You can use the *docker-storage-setup* script to create a thin-pool device and
configure docker's storage driver after installing docker but before you start
using it. The script reads configuration options from the
*_/etc/sysconfig/docker-storage-setup_* file.

. In RHEL 7, *docker-storage-setup* is provided in the RHEL Extras repository;
first, ensure the RHEL Extras repository is enabled:
+
----
# subscription-manager repos --enable=rhel-7-server-extras-rpms
----

. Install the *docker-storage-setup* package:
+
----
# yum install docker-storage-setup
----

. Configure *docker-storage-setup* for your environment. There are three options
available based on your storage configuration:

.. Create a thin-pool volume from the remaining free space in the volume group
where your root filesystem resides; this requires no configuration:
+
----
# docker-storage-setup
----

.. Use an existing volume group, in this example `docker-vg`, to create a
thin-pool:
+
----
# echo <<EOF > /etc/sysconfig/docker-storage-setup
VG=docker-vg
SETUP_LVM_THIN_POOL=yes
EOF
# docker-storage-setup
----

.. Use an unpartitioned block device to create a new volume group and thinpool.
In this example, the `/dev/vdc` device is used to create the `docker-vg` volume
group:
+
----
# cat <<EOF > /etc/sysconfig/docker-storage-setup
DEVS=/dev/vdc
VG=docker-vg
SETUP_LVM_THIN_POOL=yes
EOF
# docker-storage-setup
----

. Verify your configuration. You should have `dm.thinpooldev` value in the
`/etc/sysconfig/docker-storage` file and a `docker-pool` device:
+
[options="nowrap"]
----
# lvs
LV                  VG        Attr       LSize  Pool Origin Data%  Meta% Move Log Cpy%Sync Convert
docker-pool         docker-vg twi-a-tz-- 48.95g             0.00   0.44

# cat /etc/sysconfig/docker-storage
DOCKER_STORAGE_OPTIONS=--storage-opt dm.fs=xfs --storage-opt
dm.thinpooldev=/dev/mapper/docker--vg-docker--pool
----

. Re-initialize docker.
+
[WARNING]
====
This will destroy any docker containers or images currently on the host.
====
+
----
# systemctl stop docker
# rm -rf /var/lib/docker/*
# systemctl restart docker
----
endif::[]

*Configure Firewall Rules*

NOTE: These instructions assume you have not changed the Kubernetes/OpenShift
service subnet configuration from the default value of 172.30.0.0/16.

. OpenShift [sysitem]#firewalld# rules are currently a work in progress. During
the Beta phase, properly configure or disable the *firewalld* service. To
configure it, add `docker0` to the public zone:
+
----
# firewall-cmd --zone=trusted --change-interface=docker0
# systemctl restart firewalld
----
+
Alternatively, stop and disable the service:
+
----
# systemctl stop firewalld
# systemctl disable firewalld
----

. Enable and start the *docker* service:
+
----
# systemctl enable docker
# systemctl start docker
----

. Add `iptables` port rules for OpenShift by editing the
*_/etc/sysconfig/iptables_* file. During the Beta phase, the port range is wide
open, but it will be significantly closed in future releases. In between the
following rules:
+
----
-A INPUT -m state --state RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
-A INPUT -p icmp -j ACCEPT
----
+
Add these rules:
+
----
 -A INPUT -p tcp -m state --state NEW -m tcp --dport 10250 -j ACCEPT
 -A INPUT -p tcp -m state --state NEW -m tcp --dport 8443:8444 -j ACCEPT
 -A INPUT -p tcp -m state --state NEW -m tcp --dport 7001 -j ACCEPT
 -A INPUT -p tcp -m state --state NEW -m tcp --dport 4001 -j ACCEPT
 -A INPUT -p tcp -m state --state NEW -m tcp --dport 443 -j ACCEPT
 -A INPUT -p tcp -m state --state NEW -m tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT
----

. Enable the *iptables* service:
+
----
# systemctl enable iptables
----

. Restart the *iptables* and *docker* services:
+
----
# systemctl restart iptables
# systemctl restart docker
----
