== Overview

Builds in OpenShift are run in privileged containers that have access to the Docker daemon socket. As a security
measure, it is recommended to limit who can run builds and the strategy that is used for those builds. Docker and Custom
builds are inherently less safe than Source builds, given that they can execute any code in the build with
potentially full access to the node's Docker socket.

By default, project administrators (`admin` role) and project editors (`edit` role) are granted
permission to use all build strategies (Docker, Source-to-Image, and Custom).

Who can build with what build strategy can be controlled via an
link:../architecture/additional_concepts/authorization.html[authorization policy].
Each build strategy has a corresponding build subresource. Granting permission to `create` on the
build subresource will allow the user to create builds of that type.

== Disabling a build strategy globally
To prevent access to a particular build strategy globally, login as cluster administrator and edit
each of the default roles:

----
$ oc edit clusterrole admin
$ oc edit clusterrole edit
----

For each role, remove the line that corresponds to the resource of the strategy to disable:

.Disable the Docker build strategy for admin
=====

----
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  name: admin
...

rules:
- attributeRestrictions: null
  resources:
  - builds/custom
  - builds/docker <1>
  - builds/source
  - pods/exec
  - pods/portforward

...

----
<1> Delete this line to disable Docker builds globally for users with the admin role.

=====


== Allowing only certain users to create builds with a particular strategy

To allow only a set of specific users to create builds with a particular strategy:

1. link:#disabling-a-build-strategy-globally[Remove the build strategy resource from the default admin and edit roles].
1. Create a separate role for that build strategy
+
[#create-separate-role]
.Create a separate role for the docker build strategy
====

Create a file that defines the new cluster role (dockerstrategy.yaml):

----
kind: ClusterRole
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: dockerbuilder
rules:
- resources:
  - builds/docker
  verbs:
  - create
----


As cluster administrator, create the cluster role:

----
$ oc create -f  dockerstrategy.yaml
----

====

1. Assign the cluster role to an individual user
+
.Assign role dockerbuilder to devuser
====

----
$ oadm policy add-cluster-role-to-user dockerbuilder devuser
----

====


[WARNING]
====
Granting access to a user a cluster level to the builds/docker subresource means that the user
will be able to create builds with the Docker strategy in any project in which they can create builds.

====


== Allowing only certain users in a specific project to create builds with a particular strategy

Similar to granting the build strategy role to a user globally:

1. link:#disabling-a-build-strategy-globally[Remove the build strategy resource from the default admin and edit roles].
1. link:#create-separate-role[Create a separate role for that build strategy]
1. Assign the role to an individual user in a project
+
.Assign role dockerbuilder to devuser in project devproject
====

----
$ oadm policy add-role-to-user dockerbuilder devuser -n devproject
----

====
