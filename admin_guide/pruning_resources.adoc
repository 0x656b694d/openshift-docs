== Overview
This topic provides information on CLI operations and syntax to prune old resources
from the server that accumulate over periods of use, but are no longer needed.

== Prune Operations
The CLI groups prune operations under a common parent command.

****
`$ osadm prune _<object_type>_ _<options>_`
****

This specifies:

- The `_<object_type>_` to perform the action on, such as `builds` or `deployments`.
- The `_<options>_` supported to prune that resource type.

*Deployments*

In order to prune deployments that are no longer required by the system due to age and status, administrators
may run the following command:

****
`$ osadm prune deployments [_<options>_]`
****

.Prune Deployments CLI Configuration Options
[cols="4,8",options="header"]
|===

|Option |Description

.^|`--dry-run`
|Display the list of resources that would be pruned, but do no action. (default=true)

.^|`--orphans`
|Prune all deployments whose deployment config no longer exists, status is complete or failed, and replica count is zero. (default=false)

.^|`--keep-complete`
|Per deployment config, keep the last N deployments whose status is complete and replica count is zero. (default=5)

.^|`--keep-failed`
|Per deployment config, keep the last N deployments whose status is failed and replica count is zero. (default=1)

.^|`--keep-younger-than`
|Do not prune any object that is younger than the specified value relative to the current time. (default=60m)
|===

To perform a prune operation:

====

----
$ osadm prune deployments --dry-run=false --orphans=true --keep-complete=5 --keep-failed=1 --keep-younger-than=60m
----
====

To see what the prune will delete, without actually running the operation:

====

----
$ $ osadm prune deployments --orphans=true --keep-complete=5 --keep-failed=1 --keep-younger-than=60m
----
====

*Builds*

In order to prune builds that are no longer required by the system due to age and status, administrators
may run the following command:

****
`$ osadm prune builds [_<options>_]`
****
