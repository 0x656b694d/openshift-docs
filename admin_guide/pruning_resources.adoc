== Overview
This topic provides information on CLI operations and syntax to prune old resources
from the server that accumulate over periods of use, but are no longer needed.

== Prune Operations
The CLI groups prune operations under a common parent command.

****
`$ osadm prune _<object_type>_ _<options>_`
****

This specifies:

- The `_<object_type>_` to perform the action on, such as `builds`, `deployments`, or `images`.
- The `_<options>_` supported to prune that resource type.

*Deployments*

In order to prune deployments that are no longer required by the system due to age and status, administrators
may run the following command:

****
`$ osadm prune deployments [_<options>_]`
****

.Prune Deployments CLI Configuration Options
[cols="4,8",options="header"]
|===

|Option |Description

.^|`--confirm`
|Indicate that pruning should occur, instead of performing a dry-run. (default=false)

.^|`--orphans`
|Prune all deployments whose deployment config no longer exists, status is complete or failed, and replica count is zero. (default=false)

.^|`--keep-complete`
|Per deployment config, keep the last N deployments whose status is complete and replica count is zero. (default=5)

.^|`--keep-failed`
|Per deployment config, keep the last N deployments whose status is failed and replica count is zero. (default=1)

.^|`--keep-younger-than`
|Do not prune any object that is younger than the specified value relative to the current time. (default=60m)
|===

To perform a prune operation:

====

----
$ osadm prune deployments --confirm --orphans=true --keep-complete=5 --keep-failed=1 --keep-younger-than=60m
----
====

To see what the prune will delete, without actually running the operation:

====

----
$ $ osadm prune deployments --orphans=true --keep-complete=5 --keep-failed=1 --keep-younger-than=60m
----
====

*Builds*

In order to prune builds that are no longer required by the system due to age and status, administrators
may run the following command:

****
`$ osadm prune builds [_<options>_]`
****

.Prune Builds CLI Configuration Options
[cols="4,8",options="header"]
|===

|Option |Description

.^|`--confirm`
|Indicate that pruning should occur, instead of performing a dry-run. (default=false)

.^|`--orphans`
|Prune all builds whose build config no longer exists, status is complete, failed, error, or canceled. (default=false)

.^|`--keep-complete`
|Per build config, keep the last N builds whose status is complete. (default=5)

.^|`--keep-failed`
|Per build config, keep the last N builds whose status is failed, error, or canceled (default=1)

.^|`--keep-younger-than`
|Do not prune any object that is younger than the specified value relative to the current time. (default=60m)
|===

To perform a prune operation:

====

----
$ osadm prune builds --confirm --orphans=true --keep-complete=5 --keep-failed=1 --keep-younger-than=60m

*Images*

In order to prune images that are no longer required by the system due to age and status, administrators
may run the following command:

****
`$ osadm prune images [_<options>_]`
****

.Prune Images CLI Configuration Options
[cols="4,8",options="header"]
|===

|Option |Description

.^|`--certificate-authority`
|The path to a certificate authority file to use when communicating with the OpenShift-managed registries. Defaults to the certificate authority data from the current user's config file.

.^|`--confirm`
|Indicate that pruning should occur, instead of performing a dry-run. (default=false)

.^|`--keep-tag-revisions`
|For each image stream, keep up to at most the specified number of image revisions per tag. (default=60m)

.^|`--keep-younger-than`
|Do not prune any image that is younger than the specified value relative to the current time. Do not prune any image that is referenced by any other object that is younger than the specified value relative to the current time. (default=60m)
|===

OpenShift uses the following logic to determine which images and layers to prune:

Remove any image managed by OpenShift (see below) that was created at least `--keep-younger-than` minutes ago and is *not* currently referenced by:

- any pod created less than `--keep-younger-than` minutes ago
- any image stream created less than `--keep-younger-than` minutes ago
- any running pods
- any pending pods
- any replication controllers
- any deployment configs
- any build configs
- any builds
- the `--keep-tag-revisions` most recent items in stream.status.tags[].items

There is no support for pruning from external registries.

Images "managed by OpenShift" will have the annotation `openshift.io/image.managed`.

When an image is pruned, all references to the image are removed from all ImageStreams having a reference to the image in `status.tags`.

Image layers that are no longer referenced by any images are removed as well.

To perform a prune operation:

====

----
$ osadm prune images --confirm --keep-tag-revisions=3 --keep-younger-than=60m
----
====

To see what the prune will delete, without actually running the operation:

====

----
$ $ osadm prune builds --orphans=true --keep-complete=5 --keep-failed=1 --keep-younger-than=60m
----
