== Overview
OpenShift provides
link:../../architecture/core_objects/builds.html#source-build[STI] enabled
Perl images for building and running Perl applications.
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
The https://github.com/openshift/sti-perl[Perl STI builder image]
endif::openshift-origin[]
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
The Perl STI builder image
endif::openshift-enterprise[]
assembles your application source with any required dependencies to create a
new image containing your Perl application. This resulting image can be run 
either by OpenShift or by Docker.

== Versions
Currently, OpenShift supports version
https://github.com/openshift/sti-perl/tree/master/5.16[5.16] of Perl.

== Images

This image comes in two flavors, depending on your needs:

* RHEL 7
* CentOS 7

*RHEL 7 Based Image*

The RHEL 7 image is available through Red Hat's subscription registry via:

----
$ docker pull registry.access.redhat.com/openshift/perl-516-rhel7
----

*CentOS 7 Based Image*

This image is available on DockerHub. To download it:

----
$ docker pull openshift/perl-516-centos7
----

To use these images, you can either access them directly from these
link:../../architecture/infrastructure_components/image_registry.html[image registries],
or push them into your
link:../../admin_guide/docker_registry.html[OpenShift docker registry].
Additionally, you can create an
link:../../architecture/core_objects/openshift_model.html#imagestream[ImageStream]
that points to the image, either in your docker registry or at the external
location. Your OpenShift resources can then reference the ImageStream. You
can find
https://github.com/openshift/origin/tree/master/examples/image-streams[example]
ImageStream definitions for all the provided OpenShift images.

== Configuration
The Perl image supports a number of environment variables which can be set to
control the configuration and behavior of the Perl runtime.

To set these environment variables, you can place them into `.sti/environment`
file inside your source code repository, or define them in the environment
section of the BuildConfig Source Strategy definition.
