== Overview
OpenShift provides https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image[STI] enabled Perl images for building and running Perl applications.  These images can be used with the link:../../architecture/core_objects/builds.html#sti-build[STI build strategy].

== Versions
Currently, OpenShift only supports version https://github.com/openshift/sti-perl/tree/master/5.16[5.16] of Perl.

== Images

This image comes in two flavors, depending on your needs:

* RHEL 7
* CentOS 7

*RHEL 7 Based Image*

The RHEL 7 image is available through Red Hat's subscription registry via:

****
`$ docker pull registry.access.redhat.com/openshift/perl-516-rhel7`
****

*CentOS 7 Based Image*

This image is available on DockerHub. To download it:

****
`$ docker pull openshift/perl-516-centos7`
****

To use these images, you can either access them directly from those registries or push them into your OpenShift docker registry.  In addition, it is recommended that you create an ImageStream that points to the image, either in your docker registry or at the external location.  Your OpenShift resources can then reference the ImageStream.  You can find example ImageStream definitions for all the provided OpenShift images https://github.com/openshift/origin/tree/master/examples/image-streams[here].

== Configuration
The Perl image supports a number of environment variables which can be set to control the configuration and behavior of the Perl runtime.

To set these environment variables, you can place them into `.sti/environment` file inside your source code repository, or define them in the environment section of the BuildConfig STI Strategy definition.

* [envvar]#ENABLE_CPAN_TEST# - This variable will install all the cpan modules and run their tests. By default is the testing of the modules turned off.

* [envvar]#CPAN_MIRROR# - This variable specifies mirror URL which will cpanminus use to install dependencies. By default the URL is not specified.
