== Overview
OpenShift provides https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image[STI] enabled Ruby images for building and running Ruby applications.  These images can be used with the link:../../architecture/core_objects/builds.html#sti-build[STI build strategy].

== Versions
Currently, OpenShift only provides version https://github.com/openshift/sti-ruby/tree/master/2.0[2.0] of Ruby.

== Images

This image comes in two flavors, depending on your needs:

* RHEL 7
* CentOS 7

*RHEL 7 Based Image*

The RHEL 7 image is available through Red Hat's subscription registry via:

****
`$ docker pull registry.access.redhat.com/openshift/ruby-20-rhel7`
****

*CentOS 7 Based Image*

This image is available on DockerHub. To download it:

****
`$ docker pull openshift/ruby-20-centos7`
****

To use these images, you can either access them directly from those registries or push them into your OpenShift docker registry.  In addition, it is recommended that you create an ImageStream that points to the image, either in your docker registry or at the external location.  Your OpenShift resources can then reference the ImageStream.  You can find example ImageStream definitions for all the provided OpenShift images https://github.com/openshift/origin/tree/master/examples/image-streams[here].

== Configuration
The Ruby image supports a number of environment variables which can be set to control the configuration and behavior of the Ruby runtime.

To set these environment variables, you can place them into `.sti/environment` file inside your source code repository, or define them in the environment section of the BuildConfig STI Strategy definition.

* [envvar]#RACK_ENV# - This variable specifies the environment within which the Ruby application is deployed; for example, `production`, `development`, or `test`. Each level has different behavior in terms of logging verbosity, error pages, and ruby gem installation. The application assets are only compiled if [envvar]#RACK_ENV# is set to `production`.

* [envvar]#RAILS_ENV# - This variable specifies the environment within which the Ruby on Rails application is deployed; for example, `production`, `development`, or `test`. Each level has different behavior in terms of logging verbosity, error pages, and ruby gem installation. The application assets are only compiled if [envvar]#RAILS_ENV# is set to `production`.

* [envvar]#DISABLE_ASSET_COMPILATION# - This variable indicates that the process of asset compilation can be skipped. Asset compilation only happens when the application runs in a production environment. Therefore, you can use this variable when assets have already been compiled.
