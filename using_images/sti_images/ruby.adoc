== Overview
The OpenShift https://github.com/openshift/sti-ruby/tree/master/2.0[Ruby]
image repository contains the sources and Dockerfiles for building various
versions of Ruby platform images. The resulting images can be run either by
Docker or using https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image[STI].

== Versions
Currently, OpenShift only provides version https://github.com/openshift/sti-ruby/tree/master/2.0[2.0] of Ruby.

== Base Images

The following base images are currently available:

* RHEL 7
* CentOS 7

[NOTE]
====
In order to run the build or test action on a RHEL 7 based Ruby image, you
need to run the build on properly subscribed RHEL 7 machine.
====

== Installation
To build a Ruby image, use one of the following procedures, depending on your
base image:

*RHEL 7 Base Image*

To build a RHEL 7 based Ruby image, run the build on a properly subscribed
RHEL machine:

. Clone the following repository:
+
****
`$ git clone https://github.com/openshift/sti-ruby.git`
****
. Navigate into the directory you just created:
+
****
`$ cd sti-ruby`
****
. Build the image:
+
****
`$ make build TARGET=rhel7 VERSION=2.0`
****

*CentOS 7 Base Image*

This image is available on DockerHub. To download it:

****
`$ docker pull openshift/ruby-20-centos7`
****

Alternatively, you can build a CentOS 7 based Ruby image:

. Clone the following repository:
+
****
`$ git clone https://github.com/openshift/sti-ruby.git`
****
. Navigate into the directory you just created:
+
****
`$ cd sti-ruby`
****
. Build the image:
+
****
`$ make build VERSION=2.0`
****

[NOTE]
====
If you omit the `VERSION` parameter, the build/test action is performed on all
provided versions of Ruby. Since version `2.0` is the only version provided,
you can omit this parameter.
====

== Usage
To build a simple https://github.com/openshift/sti-ruby/tree/master/2.0/test/puma-test-app[ruby-sample-app]
Ruby application, use one of the following procedures, depending on your base image:

*RHEL 7 Base Image*

To build a RHEL 7 based image, run the build on a properly subscribed
RHEL machine:

. Build the image using https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image[STI]:
+
****
`$ sti build https://github.com/openshift/sti-ruby.git --contextDir=/2.0/test/puma-test-app/ openshift/ruby-20-rhel7 ruby-sample-app`
****
. Run the resulting image using http://docker.io[Docker]:
+
****
`$ docker run -p 8080:8080 ruby-sample-app`
****

*CentOS 7 Base Image*

To build a CentOS 7 based image:

. Build the image using https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image[STI]:
+
****
`$ sti build https://github.com/openshift/sti-ruby.git --contextDir=/2.0/test/puma-test-app/ openshift/ruby-20-centos7 ruby-sample-app`
****
. Run the resulting image using http://docker.io[Docker]:
+
****
`$ docker run -p 8080:8080 ruby-sample-app`
****

To access and test if the application is running:

****
`$ curl 127.0.0.1:8080`
****

== Testing

This repository also provides a STI test framework which checks basic functionality
of the Ruby image.

Select whether the Ruby image you are testing is RHEL based or CentOS based.

*RHEL 7 Base Image*

To test a RHEL 7 based Ruby image, run the test on a properly subscribed RHEL
machine.

. Navigate into the *_sti-ruby_* directory:
+
****
`$ cd sti-ruby`
****
. Test the image:
+
****
`$ make test TARGET=rhel7 VERSION=2.0`
****

*CentOS 7 Base Image*

To test a CentOS 7 based Ruby image:

. Navigate into the *_sti-ruby_* directory:
+
****
`$ cd sti-ruby`
****
. Test the image:
+
****
`$ make test VERSION=2.0`
****

[NOTE]
====
If you omit the `VERSION` parameter, the build/test action is performed on all
provided versions of Ruby. Since version `2.0` is the only version provided,
you can omit this parameter.

== Image Name Structure

Use the following image name structure:

****
`openshift/[replaceable]#<platform_name>#-[replaceable]#<platform_version>#-[replaceable]#<base_builder_image>#`
****

Where:

. [replaceable]#<platform_name># - Refers to the STI platform; for example, `ruby`
. [replaceable]#<platform_version># - The version of the referenced platform, without dots; for example, `20` for Ruby 2.0
. [replaceable]#<Base_builder_image># - The base OS, such as `rhel7` or `centos7`

.Example image names:
====

----
openshift/ruby-20-centos7
openshift/ruby-20-rhel7
----
====

== Environment Variables

To set these environment variables, you can place them into `.sti/environment`
file inside your source code repository.

* [envvar]#RACK_ENV# - This variable specifies the environment within which the Ruby application is deployed; for example, `production`, `development`, or `test`. Each level has different behavior in terms of logging verbosity, error pages, and ruby gem installation. The application assets are only compiled if [envvar]#RACK_ENV# is set to `production`.

* [envvar]#RAILS_ENV# - This variable specifies the environment within which the Ruby on Rails application is deployed; for example, `production`, `development`, or `test`. Each level has different behavior in terms of logging verbosity, error pages, and ruby gem installation. The application assets are only compiled if [envvar]#RAILS_ENV# is set to `production`.

* [envvar]#DISABLE_ASSET_COMPILATION# - This variable indicates that the process of asset compilation can be skipped. Asset compilation only happens when the application runs in a production environment. Therefore, you can use this variable when assets have already been compiled.
