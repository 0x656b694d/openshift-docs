== Overview
OpenShift provides
link:../../architecture/core_objects/builds.html#sti-build[STI] enabled
Ruby images for building and running Ruby applications.
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
The https://github.com/openshift/sti-ruby[Ruby STI builder image]
endif::openshift-origin[]
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
The Ruby STI builder image
endif::openshift-enterprise[]
assembles your application source with any required dependencies to create a
new image containing your Ruby application. This resulting image can be run either by OpenShift or by Docker.

== Versions
Currently, OpenShift provides version
https://github.com/openshift/sti-ruby/tree/master/2.0[2.0] of Ruby.

== Images

This image comes in two flavors, depending on your needs:

* RHEL 7
* CentOS 7

*RHEL 7 Based Image*

The RHEL 7 image is available through Red Hat's subscription registry via:

----
$ docker pull registry.access.redhat.com/openshift/ruby-20-rhel7
----

*CentOS 7 Based Image*

This image is available on DockerHub. To download it:

----
$ docker pull openshift/ruby-20-centos7
----

To use these images, you can either access them directly from these
link:../../architecture/infrastructure_components/image_registry.html[image registries],
or push them into your
link:../../admin_guide/docker_registry.html[OpenShift docker registry].
Additionally, you can create an
link:../../architecture/core_objects/openshift_model.html#imagestream[ImageStream]
that points to the image, either in your docker registry or at the external
location. Your OpenShift resources can then reference the ImageStream. You
can find
https://github.com/openshift/origin/tree/master/examples/image-streams[example]
ImageStream definitions for all the provided OpenShift images.

== Configuration
The Ruby image supports a number of environment variables which can be set to
control the configuration and behavior of the Ruby runtime.

To set these environment variables, you can place them into a
link:../../dev_guide/builds.html#environment-files[`.sti/environment`] file
inside your source code repository, or define them in the
link:../../dev_guide/builds.html#buildconfig-environment[environment section]
of the BuildConfig STI Strategy definition.

|===

|Variable name |Description

|`*RACK_ENV*`
|This variable specifies the environment within which the Ruby application is
deployed; for example, `production`, `development`, or `test`. Each level has
different behavior in terms of logging verbosity, error pages, and ruby gem
installation. The application assets are only compiled if `*RACK_ENV*` is set to
`production`; the default value is `production`.

|`*RAILS_ENV*`
|This variable specifies the environment within which the Ruby on Rails
application is deployed; for example, `production`, `development`, or `test`.
Each level has different behavior in terms of logging verbosity, error pages,
and ruby gem installation. The application assets are only compiled if
`*RAILS_ENV*` is set to `production`. This variable is set to `${RACK_ENV}` by default.

|`*DISABLE_ASSET_COMPILATION*`
|The presence of this variable disables the process of asset compilation.
Asset compilation only happens when the application runs in a production
environment. Therefore, you can use this variable when assets have already been
compiled.
