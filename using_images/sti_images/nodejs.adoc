== Overview
OpenShift provides https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image[STI] enabled NodeJS images for building and running NodeJS applications.  These images can be used with the link:../../architecture/core_objects/builds.html#sti-build[STI build strategy].

== Versions
Currently, OpenShift only provides version https://github.com/openshift/sti-nodejs/tree/master/0.10[0.10] of NodeJS.

== Images

This image comes in two flavors, depending on your needs:

* RHEL 7
* CentOS 7

*RHEL 7 Based Image*

The RHEL 7 image is available through Red Hat's subscription registry via:

****
`$ docker pull registry.access.redhat.com/openshift/nodejs-010-rhel7`
****

*CentOS 7 Based Image*

This image is available on DockerHub. To download it:

****
`$ docker pull openshift/nodejs-010-centos7`
****

To use these images, you can either access them directly from those registries or push them into your OpenShift docker registry.  In addition, it is recommended that you create an ImageStream that points to the image, either in your docker registry or at the external location.  Your OpenShift resources can then reference the ImageStream.  You can find example ImageStream definitions for all the provided OpenShift images https://github.com/openshift/origin/tree/master/examples/image-streams[here].

== Configuration
The NodeJS image does not offer any environment variable based configuration settings.
