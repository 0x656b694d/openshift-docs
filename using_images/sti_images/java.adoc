== Overview
OpenShift provides https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image[STI] enabled Java images for building and running Java applications.  These images can be used with the link:../../architecture/core_objects/builds.html#sti-build[STI build strategy].
This image is intended for use with maven based java standalone projects (that are run via main class).

== Versions
The current version can be found at https://github.com/fabric8io/java-main/tree/master/ and support JDK 1.7 and Maven 3.2.x projects.

To use this image, you can either access it directly from those registries or push it into your OpenShift docker registry.  In addition, it is recommended that you create an ImageStream that points to the image, either in your docker registry or at the external location.  Your OpenShift resources can then reference the ImageStream.  You can find example ImageStream definitions for all the provided OpenShift images https://github.com/openshift/origin/tree/master/examples/image-streams[here].

== Customizing the build

By default the image will build the project using maven with the following goals and options:

.maven default goals and options
----
    mvn package dependency:copy-dependencies -Popenshift -DskipTests -e
----

Which means that it will compile the project, copy all the transitive dependencies into the output directory, without running the tests.
In addition if the project has a profile named 'openshift' it will be activated for the build.

The user is able to override the default goals and options by specifying the following env vars.

* [envvar]#MAVEN_ARGS# The arguments that are going to be passed to the mvn command.

For example, to package and also run the tests:

.sti build with custom maven arguments
----
    sti build -e "MAVEN_ARGS=clean test package" <git repo url> fabric8/java-main <target image name>
----

=== Working with multi-module projects

Often a java project is consisted of multiple maven modules. Even though it is the developers responsibility to configure maven accordingly, sometimes its still useful to be able to specify things like:

* The output directory.
* Which modules need to be build (explicitly).

The later can be done easily by setting the appropriate maven arguments:

.multi-module build, explicitly specifying module
----
    sti build -e "MAVEN_ARGS=install -pl my.groupId:my.artifactId -am" <git repo url> fabric8/java-main <target image name>
----

The command above will tell maven to build the module with groupId 'my.groupId' and 'my.artifactId' along with all its module dependencies.

In this case, we need to know in which directory the maven project will put the artifacts, so that the sti build can pick them up. The default output directory
is considered 'target' dir inside the sources directory, but it can be overridden using the OUTPUT_DIR env var. For example:

.multi-module build, explicitly specifying module and output directory
----
    sti build -e "OUTPUT_DIR=path/to/myartifact/target,MAVEN_ARGS=install -pl my.groupId:my.artifactId -am" <git repo url> fabric8/java-main <target image name>
----

=== Specifying the main class

There are couple of options available for configuring the main class of the project:

* [envvar]#JAVA_MAIN# as an env var passed to the sti or inside `.sti/environment`
* #docker.env.Main# as a maven property inside the project.
