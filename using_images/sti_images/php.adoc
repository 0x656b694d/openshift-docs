== Overview
OpenShift provides https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image[STI] enabled PHP images for building and running PHP
applications.  These images can be used with the link:../../architecture/core_objects/builds.html#sti-build[STI build strategy].

== Versions
Currently, OpenShift only provides version https://github.com/openshift/sti-php/tree/master/5.5[5.5] of PHP.

== Images

The following base images are currently available:

* RHEL 7
* CentOS 7

*RHEL 7 Base Image*

The RHEL 7 image is available through RedHat's subscription registry via

****
`$ docker pull registry.access.redhat.com/openshift/php-55-rhel7`
****

*CentOS 7 Base Image*

This image is available on DockerHub. To download it:

****
`$ docker pull openshift/php-55-centos7`
****

To use these images, you can either access them directly in those registries or push them into your OpenShift docker registry.  
In addition, it is recommended that you create an ImageStream that points to the image, either in your docker registry
or at the external location.  Your OpenShift resources can then reference the ImageStream.  You can find example ImageStream definitions for all the provided OpenShift images https://github.com/openshift/origin/tree/master/examples/image-streams[here].

== Configuration
The PHP image supports a number of environment variables which can be set to control the configuration and
behavior of the PHP runtime.

To set these environment variables, you can place them into `.sti/environment`
file inside your source code repository, or define them in the environment section of the BuildConfig STI Strategy
definition.

The following environment variables set their equivalent property value in the php.ini file:

* **ERROR_REPORTING**
** Informs PHP of which errors, warnings and notices you would like it to take action for
** Default: E_ALL & ~E_NOTICE
* **DISPLAY_ERRORS**
** Controls whether or not and where PHP will output errors, notices and warnings
** Default: ON
* **DISPLAY_STARTUP_ERRORS**
** Cause display errors which occur during PHP's startup sequence to be handled separately from display errors
** Default: OFF
* **TRACK_ERRORS**
** Store the last error/warning message in $php_errormsg (boolean)
** Default: OFF
* **HTML_ERRORS**
** Link errors to documentation related to the error
** Default: ON
* **INCLUDE_PATH**
** Path for PHP source files
** Default: .:/opt/openshift/src:/opt/rh/php55/root/usr/share/pear
* **SESSION_PATH**
** Location for session data files
** Default: /tmp/sessions

The following environment variables set their equivalent property value in the opcache.ini file:

* **OPCACHE_MEMORY_CONSUMPTION**
** The OPcache shared memory storage size
** Default: 16M

You can also override the entire directory used to load the PHP configuration by setting:

* **PHPRC**
** Sets the path to the php.ini file
* **PHP_INI_SCAN_DIR**
** Path to scan for additional ini configuration files
