== Overview
OpenShift provides
link:../../architecture/core_objects/builds.html#source-build[S2I] enabled
Python images for building and running Python applications.
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
The https://github.com/openshift/sti-python[Python S2I builder image]
endif::openshift-origin[]
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
The Python S2I builder image
endif::openshift-enterprise[]
assembles your application source with any required dependencies to create a
new image containing your Python application. This resulting image can be run
either by OpenShift or by Docker.

== Versions
Currently, OpenShift provides version https://github.com/openshift/sti-python/tree/master/3.3[3.3] of Python.

== Images

This image comes in two flavors, depending on your needs:

* RHEL 7
* CentOS 7

*RHEL 7 Based Image*

The RHEL 7 image is available through Red Hat's subscription registry via:

----
$ docker pull registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/python-33-rhel7
----

*CentOS 7 Based Image*

This image is available on DockerHub. To download it:

----
$ docker pull openshift/python-33-centos7
----

To use these images, you can either access them directly from these
link:../../architecture/infrastructure_components/image_registry.html[image registries],
or push them into your
link:../../admin_guide/docker_registry.html[OpenShift docker registry].
Additionally, you can create an
link:../../architecture/core_objects/openshift_model.html#imagestream[ImageStream]
that points to the image, either in your docker registry or at the external
location. Your OpenShift resources can then reference the ImageStream. You
can find
https://github.com/openshift/origin/tree/master/examples/image-streams[example]
ImageStream definitions for all the provided OpenShift images.

== Configuration
The Python image supports a number of environment variables which can be set to
control the configuration and behavior of the Python runtime.

To set these environment variables, you can place them into a
link:../../dev_guide/builds.html#environment-files[`.sti/environment`] file
inside your source code repository, or define them in the
link:../../dev_guide/builds.html#buildconfig-environment[environment section]
of the BuildConfig Source Strategy definition.

|===

|Variable name |Description

|`*APP_FILE*`
|This variable specifies the file name passed to the
python interpreter which is responsible for launching the application. This variable is set to *_app.py_* by default.

|`*APP_MODULE*`
|This variable specifies the WSGI callable. It follows the pattern
`$(MODULE_NAME):$(VARIABLE_NAME)`, where the module name is a full dotted path and
the variable name refers to a function inside the specified module. If you use
`setup.py` for installing the application, then the module name can be read from
that file and the variable defaults to `application`. There is an example
https://github.com/openshift/sti-python/tree/master/3.3/test/setup-test-app[setup-test-app]
available.

|`*APP_CONFIG*`
|This variable indicates the path to a module which contains a
http://docs.gunicorn.org/en/latest/configure.html[gunicorn configuration].
