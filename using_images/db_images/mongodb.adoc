== Overview
The OpenShift https://github.com/openshift/mongodb/tree/master[MongoDB] image
repository contains the sources and Dockerfiles for building various versions of
MongoDB images. The resulting images can be run by Docker.

== Versions
Currently, OpenShift only supports version https://github.com/openshift/mongodb/tree/master/2.4[2.4] of MongoDB.

== Base Images

The following base images are currently available:

* RHEL-7
* CentOS-7

[NOTE]
====
In order to perform build or test action on a RHEL-7 based MongoDB image, you
need to run the build on properly subscribed RHEL-7 machine.
====

== Installation
To build a MongoDB image, use one of the following procedures, depending on your
base image:

*RHEL-7 Base Image*

To build a RHEL-7 based MongoDB image, run the build on a properly subscribed
RHEL machine:

. Clone the following repository:
+
****
`$ git clone https://github.com/openshift/mongodb.git`
****
. Navigate into the directory you just created:
+
****
`$ cd mongodb`
****
. Build the image:
+
****
`$ make build TARGET=rhel7 VERSION=2.4`
****

*CentOS-7 Base Image*

This image is available on DockerHub. To download it:

****
`$ docker pull openshift/mongodb-24-centos7`
****

Alternatively, you can build a CentOS-7 based MongoDB image:

. Clone the following repository:
+
****
`$ git clone https://github.com/openshift/mongodb.git`
****
. Navigate into the directory you just created:
+
****
`$ cd mongodb`
****
. Build the image:
+
****
`$ make build VERSION=2.4`
****

[NOTE]
====
If you omit the `VERSION` parameter, then the build/test action is performed on
all the supported versions of MongoDB. Currently, only version 2.4 is supported,
so you can omit this parameter.
====


== Usage

To create a container running MongoDB, you need to run following commands.

*RHEL 7 Base Image*

****
`docker run -d -e MONGODB_USERNAME=_<user>_ -e MONGODB_PASSWORD=_<password>_ -e MONGODB_DATABASE=_<database>_  openshift/mongodb-24-rhel7`
****

*CentOS 7 Base Image*

****
`docker run -d -e MONGODB_USERNAME=_<user>_ -e MONGODB_PASSWORD=_<password>_ -e MONGODB_DATABASE=_<database>_  openshift/mongodb-24-centos7`
****

== Testing

This repository also provides a test framework which checks basic functionality
of the MongoDB image.

Select whether the MongoDB image you are testing is RHEL-based or CentOS-based.

*RHEL-7 Base Image*

To test a RHEL-7-based MongoDB image, run the test on a properly subscribed RHEL
machine.

. Navigate into the *_mongodb_* directory:
+
****
`$ cd mongodb`
****
. Test the image:
+
****
`$ make test TARGET=rhel7 VERSION=2.4`
****

*CentOS-7 Base Image*

To test a CentOS-7-based MongoDB image:

. Navigate into the *_mongodb_* directory:
+
****
`$ cd mongodb`
****
. Test the image:
****
`$ make test VERSION=2.4`
****

[NOTE]
====
If you omit the `VERSION` parameter, then the build/test action is performed on
all supported versions of MongoDB. Since only version 2.4 is currently
supported, you can omit this parameter.
====

== Shared Volumes

To set only mandatory required environment variables, and store the database in
the shared *_/home/user/database_* directory on the host, execute the following
command:

****
`docker run -d -e MONGODB_USERNAME=_<user>_ -e MONGODB_PASSWORD=_<password>_ -e MONGODB_DATABASE=_<database>_ -v /home/user/database:/var/lib/mongodb openshift/_<image>_`
****

=== Initializing Database

The first time you use the shared volume and initialize the database, the
database is created along with the database administrator user and the MongoDB
root user (if you specify the `*MONGODB_ADMIN_PASSWORD*` environment variable).
Afterwards, the MongoDB daemon starts up. If you are re-attaching the volume to
another container, then the database user and the administrator user are not
created, and the MongoDB daemon starts.

== MongoDB Commands in Running Containers

OpenShift uses https://www.softwarecollections.org/[Software Collections] to
install and launch MongoDB. If you want to execute a MongoDB command inside of a
running container (for debugging), you must prefix it with the `scl enable
mongodb24` command.

To enter a container from the host:

****
`$ docker exec -it _<CONTAINER_ID>_ /bin/bash`
****

When you enter the container, the required software collection is automatically enabled.

To execute MongoDB commands inside the container:

****
`$ mongo _<db_name>_ -u _<username>_ -p _<password>_`
****

[NOTE]
====
In this case, you are able to run MongoDB commands without invoking the scl
commands.
====

== Environment Variables

The MongoDB image recognizes the following environment variables that you can
set during initialization with this command:

****
`$ docker run -e VAR=_<variable>_`
****

.MongoDB Environment Variables
[cols="4a,6a",options="header"]
|===

|Variable name |Description

|`*MONGODB_USERNAME*`
|User name for MongoDB account to be created.

|`*MONGODB_PASSWORD*`
|Password for the user account.

|`*MONGODB_DATABASE*`
|Database name.

|`*MONGODB_ROOT_PASSWORD*`
|Password for the root user. (optional)
|===

=== Settings

MongoDB settings can be configured with the following environment variables.

.Additional MongoDB Settings
[cols="3a,6a,1a",options="header"]
|===

|Variable name |Description |Default

|`*MONGODB_NOPREALLOC*`
|Disable data file preallocation.
|true

|`*MONGODB_SMALLFILES*`
|Set MongoDB to use a smaller default data file size.
|true

|`*MONGODB_QUIET*`
|Runs MongoDB in a quiet mode that attempts to limit the amount of output.
|true
|===

*Volume Mount Points*

You can set volume mount points with the following command:

****
`$ docker run -v /_<host>_:/_<container>_`
****

.Volumes
[cols="3a,3a",options="header"]
|===

|Volume mount point |Description

|`/var/lib/mongodb/`
|MongoDB data directory.
|===

=== MongoDB Root User
The root user is not set by default. You can create one when initializing the
database by setting the `MONGODB_ROOT_PASSWORD` environment variable. If you set
this environment variable, then the root user name is set to `admin`.
