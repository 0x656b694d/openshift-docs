== Overview
OpenShift provides a Docker image for running MongoDB.  This image can provide database services based on username, password, and database name settings provided via configuration.

== Versions
Currently, OpenShift only provides version https://github.com/openshift/mongodb/tree/master/2.4[2.4] of MongoDB.

== Images

This image comes in two flavors, depending on your needs:

* RHEL 7
* CentOS 7

*RHEL 7 Based Image*

The RHEL 7 image is available through Red Hat's subscription registry via:

****
`$ docker pull registry.access.redhat.com/openshift/mongodb-24-rhel7`
****

*CentOS 7 Based Image*

This image is available on DockerHub. To download it:

****
`$ docker pull openshift/mongodb-24-centos7`
****

To use these images, you can either access them directly from those registries or push them into your OpenShift docker registry.  In addition, it is recommended that you create an ImageStream that points to the image, either in your docker registry or at the external location.  Your OpenShift resources can then reference the ImageStream.  You can find example ImageStream definitions for all the provided OpenShift images https://github.com/openshift/origin/tree/master/examples/image-streams[here].

== Configuration and Usage

=== Initializing the Database

The first time you use the shared volume, the database is created along with the database administrator user and the MongoDB root user (if you specify the `*MONGODB_ADMIN_PASSWORD*` environment variable).  Afterwards, the MongoDB daemon starts up. If you are re-attaching the volume to another container then the database, database user and the administrator user are not created, and the MongoDB daemon starts.

=== Running MongoDB Commands in Containers

OpenShift uses https://www.softwarecollections.org/[Software Collections] to
install and launch MongoDB. If you want to execute a MongoDB command inside of a
running container (for debugging), you must prefix it with the `scl enable
mongodb24` command, for example: 

****
`$ docker exec -ti CONTAINER scl enable mongodb24 -- mongo`
****

To enter a container from the host:

****
`$ docker exec -it _<CONTAINER_ID>_ /bin/bash`
****

When you enter the container, the required software collection is automatically enabled.

[NOTE]
====
In this case, you are able to run MongoDB commands without invoking the scl commands.

=== Environment Variables

The MongoDB username, password, and database name can be configured with the following environment variables:

.MongoDB Environment Variables
[cols="4a,6a",options="header"]
|===

|Variable name |Description

|`*MONGODB_USERNAME*`
|User name for MongoDB account to be created.

|`*MONGODB_PASSWORD*`
|Password for the user account.

|`*MONGODB_DATABASE*`
|Database name.

|`*MONGODB_ROOT_PASSWORD*`
|Password for the root user. (optional)
|===

[NOTE]
====
The MongoDB root user is not set by default. You can create one when initializing the
database by setting the `MONGODB_ROOT_PASSWORD` environment variable. If you set
this environment variable, then the root user name is set to `admin`.
====

MongoDB settings can be configured with the following environment variables.

.Additional MongoDB Settings
[cols="3a,6a,1a",options="header"]
|===

|Variable name |Description |Default

|`*MONGODB_NOPREALLOC*`
|Disable data file preallocation.
|true

|`*MONGODB_SMALLFILES*`
|Set MongoDB to use a smaller default data file size.
|true

|`*MONGODB_QUIET*`
|Runs MongoDB in a quiet mode that attempts to limit the amount of output.
|true
|===

=== Volume Mount Points

The MongoDB image can be run with mounted volumes to enable persistent storage for the database:

* *_/var/lib/mongodb_* - This is the database directory where
MongoDB stores database files.
