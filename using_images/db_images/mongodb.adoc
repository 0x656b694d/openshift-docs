== Overview
OpenShift provides a Docker image for running MongoDB.  This image can provide
database services based on username, password, and database name settings
provided via configuration.

== Versions
Currently, OpenShift provides version
https://github.com/openshift/mongodb/tree/master/2.4[2.4] of MongoDB.

== Images

This image comes in two flavors, depending on your needs:

* RHEL 7
* CentOS 7

*RHEL 7 Based Image*

The RHEL 7 image is available through Red Hat's subscription registry via:

----
$ docker pull registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/mongodb-24-rhel7
----

*CentOS 7 Based Image*

This image is available on DockerHub. To download it:

----
$ docker pull openshift/mongodb-24-centos7
----

To use these images, you can either access them directly from these
registries or push them into your OpenShift docker registry. Additionally,
you can create an ImageStream that points to the image,
either in your docker registry or at the external location. Your OpenShift
resources can then reference the ImageStream. You can find
https://github.com/openshift/origin/tree/master/examples/image-streams[example]
ImageStream definitions for all the provided OpenShift images.

== Configuration and Usage

=== Initializing the Database

The first time you use the shared volume, the database is created along with the
database administrator user. Afterwards, the MongoDB daemon starts up. If you
are re-attaching the volume to another container, then the database, database
user, and the administrator user are not created, and the MongoDB daemon starts.

=== Running MongoDB Commands in Containers

OpenShift uses https://www.softwarecollections.org/[Software Collections] to
install and launch MongoDB. If you want to execute a MongoDB command inside of a
running container (for debugging), you must invoke it using bash, to make sure
the MongoDB collection is enabled, for example:

----
$ docker exec -ti CONTAINER /bin/bash -c mongo
----

To enter a container from the host:

----
$ docker exec -it <CONTAINER_ID> /bin/bash
----

When you enter the container, the required software collection is automatically enabled.

=== Environment Variables

The MongoDB username, password, and database name can be configured with the following environment variables:

.MongoDB Environment Variables

=== Volume Mount Points

The MongoDB image can be run with mounted volumes to enable persistent storage for the database:

* *_/var/lib/mongodb_* - This is the database directory where
MongoDB stores database files.
