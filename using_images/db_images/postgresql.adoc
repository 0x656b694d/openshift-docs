== Overview
OpenShift provides a Docker image for running PostgreSQL.  This image can 
provide database services based on username, password, and database name 
settings provided via configuration.

== Versions
Currently, OpenShift supports version
https://github.com/openshift/postgresql/tree/master/9.2[9.2] of PostgreSQL.

== Images

This image comes in two flavors, depending on your needs:

* RHEL 7
* CentOS 7

*RHEL 7 Based Image*

The RHEL 7 image is available through Red Hat's subscription registry via:

----
$ docker pull registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/postgresql-92-rhel7
----

*CentOS 7 Based Image*

This image is available on DockerHub. To download it:

----
$ docker pull openshift/postgresql-92-centos7
----

To use these images, you can either access them directly from these
registries or push them into your OpenShift docker registry. Additionally,
you can create an ImageStream that points to the image,
either in your docker registry or at the external location. Your OpenShift
resources can then reference the ImageStream. You can find
https://github.com/openshift/origin/tree/master/examples/image-streams[example]
ImageStream definitions for all the provided OpenShift images.

== Configuration and Usage

=== Initializing the Database

The first time you use the shared volume, the database is created along with 
the database administrator user and the PostgreSQL root user (if you specify 
the `*POSTGRESQL_ADMIN_PASSWORD*` environment variable).  Afterwards, the 
PostgreSQL daemon starts up. If you are re-attaching the volume to another 
container then the database, database user and the administrator user are 
not created, and the PostgreSQL daemon starts.

=== Running PostgreSQL Commands in Containers

OpenShift uses https://www.softwarecollections.org/[Software Collections] to
install and launch PostgreSQL. If you want to execute a PostgreSQL command 
inside of a running container (for debugging), you must prefix it with the 
`scl enable postgresql92` command, for example:

----
$ docker exec -ti CONTAINER scl enable postgresql92 -- psql
----

To enter a container from the host:

----
$ docker exec -it <CONTAINER_ID> /bin/bash
----

When you enter the container, the required software collection is 
automatically enabled.

[NOTE]
====
In this case, you are able to run PostgreSQL commands without invoking the scl 
commands.

=== Environment variables

The PostgreSQL username, password, and database name can be configured with 
the following environment variables:

.PostgreSQL Environment Variables
[cols="4a,6a",options="header"]
|===

|Variable name |Description

|`*POSTGRESQL_USER*`
|Username for the PostgreSQL account to be created. This user has full rights to
the database.

|`*POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD*`
|Password for the user account.

|`*POSTGRESQL_DATABASE*`
|Database name.

|`*POSTGRESQL_ADMIN_PASSWORD*`
|Optional password for the `postgres` admin user. If this is not set, then
remote login to the `postgres` account is not possible. Local connections from
within the container are always permitted without a password.
|===

PostgreSQL settings can be configured with the following environment variables.

.Additional PostgreSQL settings
[cols="3a,6a,1a",options="header"]
|===

|Variable name |Description |Default

|`*POSTGRESQL_MAX_CONNECTIONS*`
|The maximum number of client connections allowed. This also sets the maximum
number of prepared transactions.
|100

|`*POSTGRESQL_SHARED_BUFFERS*`
|Configures how much memory is dedicated to PostgreSQL for caching data.
|32M
|===

=== Volume Mount Points

The PostgreSQL image can be run with mounted volumes to enable persistent 
storage for the database:

* *_/var/lib/pgsql/data_* - This is the database cluster directory where
PostgreSQL stores database files.
