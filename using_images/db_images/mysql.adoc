== Overview
The OpenShift https://github.com/openshift/mysql/tree/master[MySQL] image
repository contains the sources and Dockerfiles for building various versions of
MySQL images. The resulting images can be run by Docker.

== Versions
Currently, OpenShift only provides version https://github.com/openshift/mysql/tree/master/5.5[5.5] of MySQL.

== Base Images

The following base images are currently available:

* RHEL 7
* CentOS 7

[NOTE]
====
In order to run the build action on a RHEL 7 based MySQL image, you need to
run the build on a properly subscribed RHEL 7 machine.
====

== Installation
To build a MySQL image, use one of the following procedures, depending on your
base image.

*RHEL 7 Base Image*

To build a RHEL 7 based MySQL image:

. Clone the following repository:
+
****
`$ git clone https://github.com/openshift/mysql.git`
****
. Navigate into the directory you just created:
+
****
`$ cd mysql`
****
. Build the image:
+
****
`$ make build TARGET=rhel7 VERSION=5.5`
****

*CentOS 7 Base Image*

This image is available on DockerHub. To download it:

****
`$ docker pull openshift/mysql-55-centos7`
****

Alternatively, you can build a CentOS 7 based MySQL image:

. Clone the following repository:
+
****
`$ git clone https://github.com/openshift/mysql.git`
****
. Navigate into the directory you just created:
+
****
`$ cd mysql`
****
. Build the image:
+
****
`$ make build VERSION=5.5`
****

[NOTE]
====
If you omit the `VERSION` parameter, the build action is performed on all
the provided versions of MySQL. Since version `5.5` is the only verision provided,
you can omit this parameter.
====

== Usage

To create a container running MySQL, you must run one of following commands,
depending on your base image.

*RHEL 7 Base Image*

To create a container running MySQL with a RHEL 7 base image:

****
`$ docker run -d -e MYSQL_USER=_<user>_ -e MYSQL_PASSWORD=_<pass>_ -e MYSQL_DATABASE=_<db>_ -p 3306:3306 openshift/mysql-55-rhel7`
****

This creates a container named with the credentials and database that you
specified.

*CentOS 7 Base Image*

To create a container running MySQL with a CentOS 7 base image:

****
`$ docker run -d -e MYSQL_USER=_<user>_ -e MYSQL_PASSWORD=_<password>_ -e MYSQL_DATABASE=_<db>_ -p 3306:3306 openshift/mysql-55-centos7`
****

To access and test if database is running:

****
`$ mysql -h 127.0.0.1 --user=_<user>_ --password=_<password>_ <<< "SELECT 1;"`
****

To properly stop the container:

****
`$ docker stop _<mysql_container>_`
****

== Testing

This repository also provides a test framework which checks basic functionality
of the MySQL image.

Select whether the MySQL image you are testing is RHEL based or CentOS based.

*RHEL 7 Base Image*

To test a RHEL 7 based MySQL image, run the test on a properly subscribed RHEL
machine.

. Navigate into the *_mysql_* directory:
+
****
`$ cd musql`
****
. Test the image:
+
****
`$ make test TARGET=rhel7 VERSION=5.5`
****

*CentOS 7 Base Image*

To test a CentOS 7 based MongoDB image:

. Navigate into the *_mysql_* directory:
+
****
`$ cd mysql`
****
. Test the image:
****
`$ make test VERSION=5.5`
****

[NOTE]
====
If you omit the `VERSION` parameter, the build/test action is performed on all
provided versions of MySQL. Since version `5.5` is the only verision provided,
you can omit this parameter.
====

== Environment variables

The image recognizes the following environment variables that you can set
during initialization with this command:

****
`$ docker run -e VAR=_<variable>_`
****
