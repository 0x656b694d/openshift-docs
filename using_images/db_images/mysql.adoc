== Overview
OpenShift provides a Docker image for running MySQL.  This image can provide 
database services based on username, password, and database name settings 
provided via configuration.

== Versions
Currently, OpenShift provides version 
https://github.com/openshift/mysql/tree/master/5.5[5.5] of MySQL.

== Images

This image comes in two flavors, depending on your needs:

* RHEL 7
* CentOS 7

*RHEL 7 Based Image*

The RHEL 7 image is available through Red Hat's subscription registry via:

----
$ docker pull registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/mysql-55-rhel7
----

*CentOS 7 Based Image*

This image is available on DockerHub. To download it:

----
$ docker pull openshift/mysql-55-centos7
----

To use these images, you can either access them directly from these
registries or push them into your OpenShift docker registry. Additionally,
you can create an ImageStream that points to the image,
either in your docker registry or at the external location. Your OpenShift
resources can then reference the ImageStream. You can find
https://github.com/openshift/origin/tree/master/examples/image-streams[example]
ImageStream definitions for all the provided OpenShift images.

== Configuration and Usage

=== Initializing the Database

The first time you use the shared volume, the database is created along with 
the database administrator user and the MySQL root user (if you specify the 
`*MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD*` environment variable).  Afterwards, the MySQL daemon 
starts up. If you are re-attaching the volume to another container, then the 
database, database user, and the administrator user are not created, and the 
MySQL daemon starts.

This example will create a new database Pod with MySQL running in a container:

----
$ oc new-app -e MYSQL_USER=<username>,MYSQL_PASSWORD=<password>,MYSQL_DATABASE=<database_name> openshift/mysql-55-centos7
----

=== Running MySQL Commands in Containers

OpenShift uses https://www.softwarecollections.org/[Software Collections] to
install and launch MySQL. If you want to execute a MySQL command inside of a
running container (for debugging), you must invoke it using bash, to make sure
the MySQL collection is enabled, for example:

----
$ oc exec -ti -p <POD> -c <CONTAINER> /bin/bash -c mysql
----

To enter a container from the host:

----
$ oc exec -ti -p <POD> -c <CONTAINER> /bin/bash
----

When you enter the container, the required software collection is automatically enabled.

=== Environment variables

The MySQL username, password, and database name must be configured with the following environment variables:

.MySQL Environment Variables
[cols="4a,6a",options="header"]
|===

|Variable name |Description

|`*MYSQL_USER*`
|Specifies the username for the database user that is created for use by your
application.

|`*MYSQL_PASSWORD*`
|Password for the `*MYSQL_USER*`.

|`*MYSQL_DATABASE*`
|Name of the database to which `*MYSQL_USER*` has full rights.

|`*MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD*`
|Optional password for the root user. If this is not set, then remote login to
the root account is not possible. Local connections from within the container
are always permitted without a password.
|===

[WARNING]
====
You must specify the username, password and database name. If you do not specify all three, the Pod will fail to start and OpenShift will continuously try to restart it.
====

MySQL settings can be configured with the following environment variables:

.Additional MySQL Settings
[cols="3a,6a,1a",options="header"]
|===

|Variable name |Description |Default

|`*MYSQL_LOWER_CASE_TABLE_NAMES*`
|Sets how the table names are stored and compared.
|0

|`*MYSQL_MAX_CONNECTIONS*`
|The maximum permitted number of simultaneous client connections.
|151

|`*MYSQL_FT_MIN_WORD_LEN*`
|The minimum length of the word to be included in a FULLTEXT index.
|4

|`*MYSQL_FT_MAX_WORD_LEN*`
|The maximum length of the word to be included in a FULLTEXT index.
|20

|`*MYSQL_AIO*`
|Controls the *innodb_use_native_aio* setting value if the native AIO is broken.
|1
|===

=== Volume Mount Points
The MySQL image can be run with mounted volumes to enable persistent storage for the database:

* *_/var/lib/mysql/data_* - This is the data directory where MySQL stores
database files.
