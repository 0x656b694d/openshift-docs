== Overview
OpenShift provides a Docker image for running MySQL.  This image can provide database services based on username, password, and database name settings provided via configuration.

== Versions
Currently, OpenShift only provides version https://github.com/openshift/mysql/tree/master/5.5[5.5] of MySQL.

== Images

This image comes in two flavors, depending on your needs:

* RHEL 7
* CentOS 7

*RHEL 7 Based Image*

The RHEL 7 image is available through Red Hat's subscription registry via:

****
`$ docker pull registry.access.redhat.com/openshift/mysql-55-rhel7`
****

*CentOS 7 Based Image*

This image is available on DockerHub. To download it:

****
`$ docker pull openshift/mysql-55-centos7`
****

To use these images, you can either access them directly from those registries or push them into your OpenShift docker registry.  In addition, it is recommended that you create an ImageStream that points to the image, either in your docker registry or at the external location.  Your OpenShift resources can then reference the ImageStream.  You can find example ImageStream definitions for all the provided OpenShift images https://github.com/openshift/origin/tree/master/examples/image-streams[here].

== Configuration and Usage

=== Initializing the Database

The first time you use the shared volume, the database is created along with the database administrator user and the MySQL root user (if you specify the `*MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD*` environment variable).  Afterwards, the MySQL daemon starts up. If you are re-attaching the volume to another container then the database, database user and the administrator user are not created, and the MySQL daemon starts.

=== Running MySQL Commands in Containers

OpenShift uses https://www.softwarecollections.org/[Software Collections] to
install and launch MySQL. If you want to execute a MySQL command inside of a
running container (for debugging), you must prefix it with the `scl enable
mysql55` command, for example: 

****
`$ docker exec -ti CONTAINER scl enable mysql55 -- mysql -h 127.0.0.1 -u user -ppassword`
****

To enter a container from the host:

****
`$ docker exec -it _<CONTAINER_ID>_ /bin/bash`
****

When you enter the container, the required software collection is automatically enabled.

[NOTE]
====
In this case, you are able to run MySQL commands without invoking the scl commands.

=== Environment variables

The MySQL username, password, and database name can be configured with the following environment variables:

.MySQL Environment Variables
[cols="4a,6a",options="header"]
|===

|Variable name |Description

|`*MYSQL_USER*`
|Specifies the username for the database user that is created for use by your
application.

|`*MYSQL_PASSWORD*`
|Password for the `*MYSQL_USER*`.

|`*MYSQL_DATABASE*`
|Name of the database to which `*MYSQL_USER*` has full rights.

|`*MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD*`

the root account is not possible. Local connections from within the container
are always permitted without a password.

|The minimum length of the word to be included in a FULLTEXT index.
|4

|`*MYSQL_FT_MAX_WORD_LEN*`
|The maximum length of the word to be included in a FULLTEXT index.

=== Volume Mount Points
The MySQL image can be run with mounted volumes to enable persistent storage for the database:

* *_/var/lib/mysql/data_* - This is the data directory where MySQL stores
database files.
