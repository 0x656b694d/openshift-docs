== Overview
The OpenShift MySQL database image
https://github.com/openshift/mysql[repository] contains the sources and
Dockerfiles for building MySQL database images. The resulting images can be run
by Docker.

== Versions
Currently, OpenShift only supports version https://github.com/openshift/mysql/tree/master/5.5[5.5] of MySQL.

== Base Images

The following base images are currently available:

* RHEL-7
* CentOS-7

[NOTE]
====
A RHEL-7 image is not available at https://registry.hub.docker.com/[Docker Hub].
In order to perform a build action on a RHEL-7 based MySQL image, you need to
run the build on a properly subscribed RHEL-7 machine.
====

== Installation
To build a MySQL image, use one of the following procedures, depending on your
base image.

*RHEL-7 Base Image*

To build a RHEL-7 based MySQL image:

. Clone the following repository:
+
****
`$ git clone https://github.com/openshift/mysql.git`
****
. Navigate into the directory you just created:
+
****
`$ cd mysql`
****
. Build the image:
+
****
`$ make build TARGET=rhel7 VERSION=5.5`
****

*CentOS-7 Base Image*

This image is available on DockerHub. To download it:

****
`$ docker pull openshift/mysql-55-centos7`
****

Alternatively, you can build a CentOS-7 based MySQL image:

. Clone the following repository:
+
****
`$ git clone https://github.com/openshift/mysql.git`
****
. Navigate into the directory you just created:
+
****
`$ cd mysql`
****
. Build the image:
+
****
`$ make build VERSION=5.5`
****

[NOTE]
====
If you omit the `*VERSION*` parameter, then the build action is performed on all
the supported versions of MySQL. Currently, only version 5.5 is supported, so
you can omit this parameter.
====

== Creating a Container
To create a container running MySQL, you must run one of following commands,
depending on your base image.

*RHEL-7 Base Image*

To create a container running MySQL with a RHEL-7 base image:
****
`$ docker run -d --name _<mysql_database>_ -e MYSQL_USER=_<user>_ -e MYSQL_PASSWORD=_<pass>_ -e MYSQL_DATABASE=_<db>_ -p 3306:3306 openshift/mysql-55-rhel7`
****

This creates a container named with the credentials and database that you
specified.

*CentOS-7 Base Image*

To create a container running MySQL with a CentOS-7 base image:

****
`$ docker run -d --name _<mysql_database>_ -e MYSQL_USER=_<user>_ -e MYSQL_PASSWORD=_<password>_ -e MYSQL_DATABASE=_<db>_ -p 3306:3306 openshift/mysql-55-centos7`
****

This creates a container named with the credentials and database that you
specified.

== Testing

To access and test if the application is running:

****
`$ mysql -h 127.0.0.1 --user=_<user>_ --password=_<password>_ <<< "SELECT 1;"`
****

== Stopping the Container

To properly stop the container:

****
`$ docker stop _<mysql_database>_`
****

== Environment variables

The image recognizes the following environment variables that you can set
during initialization with this command:

****
`$ docker run -e VAR=_<variable>_`
****
