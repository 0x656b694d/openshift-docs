== Overview
OpenShift provides
link:../../architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.html#source-build[S2I]
enabled Perl images for building and running Perl applications.
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
The https://github.com/openshift/sti-perl[Perl S2I builder image]
endif::openshift-origin[]
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
The Perl S2I builder image
endif::openshift-enterprise[]
assembles your application source with any required dependencies to create a
new image containing your Perl application. This resulting image can be run
either by OpenShift or by Docker.

== Versions
Currently, OpenShift supports version
https://github.com/openshift/sti-perl/tree/master/5.16[5.16] of Perl.

== Images

This image comes in two flavors, depending on your needs:

* RHEL 7
* CentOS 7

*RHEL 7 Based Image*

The RHEL 7 image is available through Red Hat's subscription registry via:

----
$ docker pull registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/perl-516-rhel7
----

*CentOS 7 Based Image*

This image is available on DockerHub. To download it:

----
$ docker pull openshift/perl-516-centos7
----

To use these images, you can either access them directly from these
link:../../architecture/infrastructure_components/image_registry.html[image registries],
or push them into your
link:../../install_config/install/docker_registry.html[OpenShift docker registry].
Additionally, you can create an
link:../../architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.html#image-streams[image stream]
that points to the image, either in your docker registry or at the external
location. Your OpenShift resources can then reference the ImageStream. You
can find
https://github.com/openshift/origin/tree/master/examples/image-streams[example]
ImageStream definitions for all the provided OpenShift images.

== Configuration
The Perl image supports a number of environment variables which can be set to
control the configuration and behavior of the Perl runtime.

To set these environment variables, you can place them into `.sti/environment`
file inside your source code repository, or define them in the environment
section of the BuildConfig Source Strategy definition.

.Perl Environment Variables
[cols="4a,6a",options="header"]
|===

|Variable name |Description

|`*ENABLE_CPAN_TEST*`
|This variable installs all the cpan modules and runs their tests. By default,
the testing of the modules is turned off.

|`*CPAN_MIRROR*`
|This variable specifies a mirror URL which
cpanminus uses to install dependencies. By default, this URL is not specified.

ifdef::openshift-origin[]
|`*PERL_APACHE2_RELOAD*`
|Set this to "true" to enable automatic reloading of modified Perl modules.
By default, automatic reloading is turned off.  Warning: You should only use
this option while developing or debugging, it is not recommended to turn this
on in your production environment.
endif::openshift-origin[]

== Hot Deploy
To enable hot deploy in this image, you have to set the `*PERL_APACHE2_RELOAD*`
environment variable to `true`. You can use
link:../../dev_guide/environment_variables.html#set-environment-variables[oc env]
to update environment variables of existing objects.

To change your source code in a running Pod, use the
link:../../cli_reference/basic_cli_operations.html#troubleshooting-and-debugging-cli-operations[oc rsh]
command to enter the container:

	$ oc rsh <POD_ID>

After you enter into the running container, your current directory is set to
`/opt/app-root/src`, where the source code is located.
