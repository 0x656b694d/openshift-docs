== Overview
OpenShift provides
link:../../architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.html#source-build[S2I]
enabled PHP images for building and running PHP applications.
ifdef::openshift-origin[]
The https://github.com/openshift/sti-php[PHP S2I builder image]
endif::openshift-origin[]
ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
The PHP S2I builder image
endif::openshift-enterprise[]
assembles your application source with any required dependencies to create a
new image containing your PHP application. This resulting image can be run
either by OpenShift or by Docker.

== Versions
Currently, OpenShift provides version
https://github.com/openshift/sti-php/tree/master/5.5[5.5] of PHP.

== Images

This image comes in two flavors, depending on your needs:

* RHEL 7
* CentOS 7

*RHEL 7 Based Image*

The RHEL 7 image is available through Red Hat's subscription registry using:

----
$ docker pull registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/php-55-rhel7
----

*CentOS 7 Based Image*

This image is available on DockerHub. To download it:

----
$ docker pull openshift/php-55-centos7
----

To use these images, you can either access them directly from these
link:../../architecture/infrastructure_components/image_registry.html[image
registries], or push them into your
link:../../install_config/install/docker_registry.html[OpenShift Docker
registry]. Additionally, you can create an
link:../../architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.html#image-streams[image
stream] that points to the image, either in your Docker registry or at the
external location. Your OpenShift resources can then reference the ImageStream.
You can find
https://github.com/openshift/origin/tree/master/examples/image-streams[example
image stream definitions] for all the provided OpenShift images.

== Configuration
The PHP image supports a number of environment variables which can be set to
control the configuration and behavior of the PHP runtime.

To set these environment variables, you can place them into
link:../../dev_guide/builds.html#environment-files[a *_.sti/environment_* file]
inside your source code repository, or define them in
link:../../dev_guide/builds.html#buildconfig-environment[the environment
section] of the build configuration's `*sourceStrategy*` definition.

The following environment variables set their equivalent property value in the
php.ini file:

.PHP Environment Variables
[cols="4a,6a,6a",options="header"]
|===

|Variable name |Description |Default

|`*ERROR_REPORTING*`
|Informs PHP of the errors, warnings, and notices for which you would like it to take action.
|E_ALL & ~E_NOTICE

|`*DISPLAY_ERRORS*`
|Controls if and where PHP outputs errors, notices, and warnings.
|ON

|`*DISPLAY_STARTUP_ERRORS*`
|Causes any display errors that occur during PHP's startup sequence to be
handled separately from display errors.
|OFF

|`*TRACK_ERRORS*`
|Stores the last error/warning message in `*$php_errormsg*` (boolean).
|OFF

|`*HTML_ERRORS*`
|Links errors to documentation that is related to the error.
|ON

|`*INCLUDE_PATH*`
|Path for PHP source files.
|.:/opt/openshift/src:/opt/rh/php55/root/usr/share/pear

|`*SESSION_PATH*`
|Location for session data files.
|/tmp/sessions
|===

The following environment variable sets its equivalent property value in the opcache.ini file:

.Additional PHP settings
[cols="3a,6a,1a",options="header"]
|===

|Variable name |Description |Default

|`*OPCACHE_MEMORY_CONSUMPTION*`
|The OPcache shared memory storage size.
|16M
|===

You can also override the entire directory used to load the PHP configuration by setting:

.Additional PHP settings
[cols="3a,6a",options="header"]
|===

| Variable name | Description

|`*PHPRC*`
|Sets the path to the php.ini file.

|`*PHP_INI_SCAN_DIR*`
|Path to scan for additional ini configuration files
|===

=== Apache Configuration
If the `*DocumentRoot*` of the application is nested in the source directory
*_/opt/openshift/src_*, you can provide your own *_.htaccess_* file to override
the default Apache behavior and specify how application requests should be
handled. The *_.htaccess_* file must be located at the root of the application
source.

[[php-logging]]

== Accessing Logs
Access logs are streamed to standard out and as such they can be viewed using
link:../../cli_reference/basic_cli_operations.html#troubleshooting-and-debugging-cli-operations[the
`oc logs` command]. Error logs are stored in the *_/tmp/error_log_* file, which
can be viewed using link:../../dev_guide/executing_remote_commands.html[the `oc
exec` command] to access the container.

[[php-hot-deploy]]

== Hot Deploying
Hot deployment allows you to quickly make and deploy changes to your application
without having to generate a new S2I build. Hot deployment works in this image
out of the box.

To change your source code in a running pod, use
link:../../cli_reference/basic_cli_operations.html#troubleshooting-and-debugging-cli-operations[the
`oc rsh` command] to enter the container:

----
$ oc rsh <pod_id>
----

After you enter into the running container, your current directory is set to
*_/opt/app-root/src_*, where the source code is located.
