The {ProductName} operator supports multi-tenant control plane installations.

[NOTE]
====
* You cannot use multi-tenant control plane installations in conjunction with a cluster-wide control plane installation. {ProductName} installations must either be multi-tenant or single, cluster-wide installations.

* Single-tenant control plane installations are known to cause issues with {product-title} restarts and upgrades. Multi-tenant control plane installations are the default configuration starting with {ProductName} {ProductVersion}.
