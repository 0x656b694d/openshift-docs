= Restoring a project

To restore a project, create the new project, then restore any exported files
by running `oc create -f <file_name>`.

[discrete]
== Procedure

. Create the project:
+
----
$ oc new-project <project_name> <1>
----
+
<1> This `<project_name>` value must match the name of the project that was backed up.

. Import the project objects:
+
----
$ oc create -f project.yaml
----

. Import any other resources that you exported when backing up the project, such as role bindings, secrets, service accounts, and persistent volume claims:
+
----
$ oc create -f <object>.yaml
----
+
Some resources might fail to import if they require another object to exist. If this occurs, review the error message to identify which resources must be imported first.

[WARNING]
====
Some resources, such as pods and default service accounts, can fail to be created.
