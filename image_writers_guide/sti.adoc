== Overview
The main advantage of using STI for building reproducible Docker images is the ease of use for developers. As a builder image author, you must be aware of the two basic requirements for the best possible STI performance: the required image contents and STI scripts.

== Required Image Contents
The build process consists of three fundamental elements which are combined into a final Docker image:

- sources
- STI scripts
- builder image

During the build process, STI must place sources and scripts inside the builder image. To do so, STI creates a tar file that contains the sources and scripts, then streams that file into the builder image. Before executing the `sti assemble` script, STI untars that file and places its contents into the location specified with the `--location` flag or the `STI_LOCATION` environment variable from the builder image, with the default location being the [filename]#/tmp# directory.

For this tar process to happen, your image must supply the tar archiving utility (the `tar` command available in [filename]#$PATH#) and the command line interpreter (the `/bin/sh` command); this allows your image to use the fastest possible build path. If the `tar` or `/bin/sh` command is not available, the `sti build` script is forced to automatically perform an additional Docker build to put both the sources and the scripts inside the image, and only then run the usual `sti build` procedure.

See the following diagram for the basic STI build workflow:

.Build workflow
image::sti-flow.png[STI workflow]

////
* Run build's responsibility is to untar the sources, scripts and artifacts (if such exist) and invoke `assemble` script. If this is second run (after catching `tar`/`/bin/sh` error) it's responsible only for invoking `assemble` script, since both scripts and sources are already there.
////

== STI Scripts
You can supply the following scripts to STI:

* link:#assemble[`assemble`] (required)
* link:#run[`run`] (required)
* link:#save-artifacts[`save-artifacts`] (optional)
* link:#usage[`usage`] (optional)

You can write the scripts in any programming language as long as the scripts are executable inside the builder image.

NOTE: The examples in the following sections are written in Bash and it is assumed all tar contents are unpacked into the [filename]#/tmp/sti# directory.

[[assemble]]
*`assemble`*

The `assemble` script builds the application artifacts from source and places them into appropriate directories inside the image. The workflow for the `assemble` script is:

. Restore build artifacts. If you want to support incremental builds, make sure to define link:#save-artifacts[`save-artifacts`] as well.
. Place the application source in the desired location.
. Build the application artifacts.
. Install the artifacts into locations appropriate for them to run.

.Example `assemble` script:
====

----
#!/bin/bash

# restore build artifacts
if [ "$(ls /tmp/sti/artifacts/ 2>/dev/null)" ]; then
    mv /tmp/sti/artifacts/* $HOME/.
fi

# move the application source
mv /tmp/sti/src $HOME/src

# build application artifacts
pushd ${HOME}
make all

# install the artifacts
make install
popd
----
====

[[run]]
*`run`*

The `run` script executes your application.

.Example `run` script:
====

----
#!/bin/bash

# run the application
/opt/application/run.sh
----
====

[[save-artifacts]]
*`save-artifacts`*

The `save-artifacts` script gathers all dependencies that can speed up the build processes that follow. For example:

- For Ruby, `gems` is installed by Bundler.
- For Java, `.m2` contents are installed.

These dependencies are gathered into a tar file and streamed to the standard output.

.Example `save-artifacts` script:
====

----
#!/bin/bash

pushd ${HOME}
if [ -d deps ]; then
    # all deps contents to tar stream
    tar cf - deps
fi
popd

----
====

[[usage]]
*`usage`*

The `usage` script is for you to inform the user how to properly use your image.

.Example `usage` script:
====

----
#!/bin/bash

# inform the user how to use the image
cat <<EOF
This is a STI sample builder image, to use it, install
https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image
EOF
----
====

*`test/run`*

The `test/run` script is for you to create a simple process to check if the image is working correctly. The proposed flow of that process
is:

. Build the image.
. Run the image to verify the `usage` script.
. Run `sti build` to verify the `assemble` script.
. Run `sti build` again to verify the `save-artifacts` script and the `assemble` script's restore artifacts functionality. (optional)
. Run the image to verify the test application is working.

See the link:sti_testing.html[Testing STI Images] topic for more information.

NOTE: The suggested location to put the test application built by your `test/run` script is the [filename]#test/test-app# directory in your image repository. See the
https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image/blob/master/docs/cli.md#sti-create[STI documentation] for more information.
