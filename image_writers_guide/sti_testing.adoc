== Overview

This document covers how as a STI builder image author you can test your
STI image locally and how you can use the OpenShift build system for automated
testing and continuous integration.

Read more about the link:sti[STI architecture and requirements] before reading
any further.

== The Goal

As described in the STI documentation, STI requires 'assemble' and 'run'
commands to be present in order to successfully execute the STI build.  You can
also provide the 'save-artifacts' command for reusing the build artifacts and
the 'usage' command that prints the usage to console when someone runs the
Docker image outside the STI.

The goal of testing the STI image is to make sure that all commands described
above work properly, even if the base Docker image changed or the tooling that
the commands are using was updated.

== Testing Requirements

The standard location for the 'test' command is 'test/run'. This command is
invoked by the OpenShift STI image builder and it could be a simple Bash script
or a static Go binary.

Since the 'test/run' command will perform the STI build, you should have STI
binary available in your system. See the STI
https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image/blob/master/README.md#installation[README]
file and follow the installation instructions.

Since the STI is putting together the application source code and Docker image,
in order to test it, we  need a sample application source we can use during the
test to verify the application source gets successfully converted into a Docker
image. The sample application should be simple, but it should also exercise the
'assemble' command.

== Using sti create

The STI tooling comes with powerful generation tools to speed up the process of
a new STI image creation. The
https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image/blob/master/docs/cli.md#sti-create:[sti
create] command will produce all necessary STI scripts and testing tools along with the
Makefile. The generated 'test/run' script is very simple and needs some
adjusting to be useful, but it should give you a solid ground to start hacking.

One thing you need to keep in mind is that the 'test/run' script produced by
'sti create' command require the sample application sources inside the
'test/test-app' directory.

== Testing locally

The easiest way to run the STI image tests locally is to use the generated
Makefile. In case you did not use the 'sti create' command, you can copy the
Makefile template below and replace the IMAGE_NAME with your image name.

Sample Makefile:
---
IMAGE_NAME = openshift/ruby-20-centos

build:
	docker build -t $(IMAGE_NAME) .

.PHONY: test
test:
	docker build -t $(IMAGE_NAME)-candidate .
	IMAGE_NAME=$(IMAGE_NAME)-candidate test/run
---

== Basic work flow

This section describes the default work flow you should be using for testing the
STI image builders:

First build the STI image using 'docker build -t BUILDER_IMAGE_NAME'

1. docker run BUILDER_IMAGE_NAME <verify the usage script is working>
1. sti build file:///path-to-sample-app BUILDER_IMAGE_NAME OUTPUT_APPLICATION_IMAGE_NAME
1. <in case you support save-artifacts, execute 2. step again to verify that
   restoring artifacts works properly>
1. docker run OUTPUT_APPLICATION_IMAGE_NAME
1. <verify the container is running and the application is responding>

Executing all the steps above, should be usually enough to tell if the STI
commands operates properly.

== Using OpenShift Build for Automated Testing

Another way you can execute the STI image tests is to use OpenShift platform
itself as a continuous integration system. OpenShift knows how to build the
Docker images and it allows a lot of customization. To setup a STI image builder
CI, you have to define a special 'CustomBuild' and use the
'openshift/sti-image-builder' image. This image is capable to execute all the
steps mentioned in the section above and produce a new STI builder image.


Sample CustomBuild:
---
{
  "kind": "BuildConfig",
  "apiVersion": "v1beta1",
  "metadata":{
    "name": "ruby-20-centos-build"
  },
  "triggers": [
    {
      "type": "github",
      "github": {
        "secret": "secret101"
      }
    },
  ],
  "parameters": {
    "source" : {
      "type" : "Git",
      "git" : {
        "uri": "git://github.com/openshift/ruby-20-centos.git"
      }
    },
    "strategy": {
      "type": "Custom",
      "customStrategy": {
        "image": "openshift/sti-image-builder",
        "exposeDockerSocket": true,
        "env": [
          { "name": "IMAGE_NAME", "value": "openshift/ruby-20-centos"}
        ]
      }
    }
  },
  "labels": {
    "name": "ruby-20-centos-build"
  }
}
---

You can use 'osc create' command to create this BuildConfig. Once the
BuildConfig is created, you can start the build using this command:

---
osc start-build ruby-20-centos-build
---

If you are hosting OpenShift on a public IP address, then the build will be
triggered every time you push into your STI builder image Github repository.

You can also use the CustomBuild to trigger a rebuild for your applications
based on the STI image you updated. In that case, you need to specify the
'Output' field in the 'parameters' section and say to which Docker registry the
image should be pushed after a successfull build.
