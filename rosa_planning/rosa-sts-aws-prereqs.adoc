toc::[]

Ensure that the following AWS prerequisites are met before installing ROSA with STS.

include::modules/rosa-aws-understand.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

[IMPORTANT]
====
When you create a ROSA cluster using AWS STS, an associated AWS OpenID Connect (OIDC) identity provider is created as well. This OIDC provider configuration relies on a public key that is located in the `us-east-1` AWS region. Customers with AWS SCPs must allow the use of the `us-east-1` AWS region, even if these clusters are deployed in a different region.
