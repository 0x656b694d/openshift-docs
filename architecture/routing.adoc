== Overview
Routers provide external DNS mapping and load balancing to
link:kubernetes_model.html#service[services] over protocols that pass
distinguishing information directly to the router. Routers support the following
protocols:

- HTTP
- HTTPS
- WebSockets
- TLS with SNI

NOTE: WebSocket traffic uses the same route conventions and supports the same
TLS termination types as other traffic.

The router uses the service selector to watch the endpoints that support the
service, bypassing its logic and replacing it with the router's own. Routers
subscribe to a configuration and automatically update themselves with any
changes. Router may be containerized or virtual, converting any changes to API
calls to another system, such as *F5*.

Other capabilities exist to load-balance a service within a cluster. These
services are exposed via a configurable link relation between different
services, and ensure a set of services can be available.
link:../using_openshift/deployments.html[Deployments] can use these services as
local proxies for each host, or reuse the shared routing infrastructure.

As an OpenShift administrator, you can configure routers in your instance. This
allows developers to then set the route types for their projects.

== Route Types
Routes can be either secure or unsecure. Secure routes provide the ability to
use different types of TLS termination to serve certificates to the client.
Routers support link:#edge-termination[edge],
link:#passthrough-termination[passthrough], and
link:#re-encryption-termination[re-encryption] termination.

To create a secure route, specify the TLS termination of the route in a JSON
file.

    "host": "www.example.com",
    "path": "/test",
    "serviceName": "hello-nginx"
}
----

====

IMPORTANT: While both secure and unsecure routes are possible with an OpenShift instance, Red Hat recommends a secure routing service.

== Path Based Routes
Path based routes specify a path component that can be compared against a URL. This implies that the traffic for the route is HTTP based. Routers should match routes based on the most specific path to the least. However, this depends on your implementation. For example:

*  For a route with www.example.com/test:
** www.example.com/test should be accessible
** www.example.com should not be accessible
*  For routes with www.example.com/test and www.example.com:
** www.example.com/test should be accessible
** www.example.com should be accessible
*  For routes with www.example.com:
** www.example.com/test should be accessible (matched by the host, not the route)
** www.example.com should be accessible

== Securing Routes
You can create a secure route to your pods by specifying the TLS termination of
the route and, optionally, providing certificates.

NOTE: Currently, TLS termination in OpenShift Beta relies on SNI for serving
custom certificates. Any non-SNI traffic received on port 443 has TLS
termination with a generic certificate. In the future, the ability to create
custom front ends within the router will allow all traffic to serve custom
certificates.

By default, OpenShift routes are unsecure, but can be set to any of the
following three types of secure TLS termination.

[[edge-termination]]
*Edge Termination*

With edge termination, TLS termination occurs prior to traffic reaching its
destination. TLS certificates are served by the front end of the router.

You can configure edge termination on your route by specifying the following:

.Configuring Edge Termination
====

----
{
    "metadata": {
        "name": "route-edge"
    },
    "id": "route-edge",
    "apiVersion": "v1beta1",
    "kind": "Route",
    "host": "www.example.com",
    "serviceName": "hello-nginx",
    "tls": {
        "termination": "edge", <1>
        "certificate": "CERT TEXT OMITTED FOR READABILITY", <2>
        "key": "CERT TEXT OMITTED FOR READABILITY", <3>
        "caCertificate": "CERT TEXT OMITTED FOR READABILITY" <4>
     }
}
----

<1> Set the `*termination*` field to `edge`.
<2> Set the `*certificate*` field to the contents of the certificate file. See
the link:#special-notes[special notes] below.
<3> Set the `*key*` field to the contents of the key file. See the
link:#special-notes[special notes] below.
<4> Set the `*caCertificate*` field to the contents of the CA certificate file.
See the link:#special-notes[special notes] below.
====

[[passthrough-termination]]
*Passthrough Termination*

With passthrough termination, encrypted traffic is sent straight to the
destination without the router providing TLS termination.

You can configure passthrough termination on your route by specifying the
following:

.Configuring Passthrough Termination
====

----
{
    "metadata": {
        "name": "route-secure"
    },
    "id": "route-secure",
    "apiVersion": "v1beta1",
    "kind": "Route",
    "host": "www.example.com",
    "serviceName": "hello-nginx-secure",
    "tls": { "termination" : "passthrough" } <1>
}
----

<1> Set the `*termination*` field to `passthrough`.
====

The destination, such as an *Nginx*, *Apache*, or another *HAProxy* instance, is
then responsible for serving certificates for the traffic.

[[re-encryption-termination]]
*Re-encryption Termination*

Re-encryption is a type of edge termination where the client encrypts
communication with a certificate, which is then re-encrypted with a different
certificate when the traffic reaches the destination. The router uses health
checks to determine the authenticity of the host.

You can configure re-encryption termination on your route by specifying the
following:

.Configuring Re-encryption Termination
====

----
{
    "metadata": {
        "name": "route-reencrypt"
    },
    "id": "route-reencrypt",
    "apiVersion": "v1beta1",
    "kind": "Route",
    "host": "www.example2.com",
    "serviceName": "hello-nginx-secure",
    "tls": {
        "termination": "reencrypt", <1>
        "certificate": "CERT TEXT OMITTED FOR READABILITY", <2>
        "key": "CERT TEXT OMITTED FOR READABILITY", <3>
        "caCertificate": "CERT TEXT OMITTED FOR READABILITY", <4>
        "destinationCaCertificate": "CERT TEXT OMITTED FOR READABILITY" <5>
     }
}
----

<1> Set the `*termination*` field to `reencrypt`.
<2> Set the `*certificate*` field to the contents of the certificate file. See
the link:#special-notes[special notes] below.
<3> Set the `*key*` field to the contents of the key file. See the
link:#special-notes[special notes] below.
<4> Set the `*caCertificate*` field to the contents of the CA certificate file.
See the link:#special-notes[special notes] below.
<5> Use the `*destinationCaCertificate*` field to validate the secure connection
from the router to the destination, specific to each implementation. See the
link:#special-notes[special notes] below.
====

[[special-notes]]
*Special Notes About Secure Routes*

Currently, password protected key files are not supported. HAProxy prompts you
for a password upon starting and does not have a way to automate this process.
To remove a passphrase from a keyfile, you can run:

****
`# openssl rsa -in _passwordProtectedKey.key_ -out _new.key_`
****

When creating a secure route, you must include your certificate files as a
single line of text. Replace the existing line breaks with:

****
`\\n`
****

Note the double slash, which is required by the JSON spec.

== Routers
A template router provides certain infrastructure information to the underlying
router implementation, such as:

- A wrapper that watches endpoints and routes.
- Endpoint and route data, which is saved into a consumable form.
- Passing the internal state to a configurable template and executing the
template.
- Calling a reload script.

Router plug-ins assume they can bind to host ports 80 and 443. This is to allow
external traffic to route to the host and subsequently through the router.
Routers also assume that networking is configured such that it can access all
pods in the cluster.

At the time of writing, a template router is the single type of router plug-in
available in OpenShift.

[[haproxy-template-router]]
*HAProxy Template Router*

The HAProxy template router implementation is the reference implementation for a
template router plug-in. This uses the `openshift/origin-haproxy-router`
repository to run an HAProxy instance alongside the template router plug-in. To
test routes, an install script is provided in the *_hack/install-router.sh_*
file.

The router script requires two parameters: the router ID and the full URL to the
master. It attempts to create the router based on the generated JSON file if it
can find the `osc` executable on the path. If it cannot find the executable, it
creates the JSON file and displays the location. You can then manually run the
create command.

.Running the Router Script

The following diagram illustrates how data flows from the master through the
plug-in and finally into an HAProxy configuration:

== Highly-available Routers
You can configure a highly-available router setup by running multiple instances
of the router pod and fronting them with a balancing tier. This can be something
as simple as DNS round robin or as complex as multiple load-balancing layers.

[[dns-round-robin]]
*DNS Round Robin*

As a simple example, you can create a zone file for a DNS server, such as BIND,
that maps multiple A records for a single domain name. When clients do a lookup,
they are given one of the many records, in order, as a round robin scheme.

[NOTE]
====
The procedure below uses wildcard DNS with multiple A records to achieve the
desired round robin. The wildcard could be further distributed into shards with:

****
`*._<shard>_`
****
====

.To Configure Simple DNS Round Robin:
. Add a new zone that points to your file:
+
====

----
#### named.conf
    zone "v3.rhcloud.com" IN {
            type master;
            file "v3.rhcloud.com.zone";
    };

----
====

. Define the round robin mappings for the DNS lookup:
+
====

----
#### v3.rhcloud.com.zone
    $ORIGIN v3.rhcloud.com.

    @       IN      SOA     . v3.rhcloud.com. (
                         2009092001         ; Serial
                             604800         ; Refresh
                              86400         ; Retry
                            1206900         ; Expire
                                300 )       ; Negative Cache TTL
            IN      NS      ns1.v3.rhcloud.com.
    ns1     IN      A       127.0.0.1
    *       IN      A       10.245.2.2
            IN      A       10.245.2.3


----
====

. Test the entry. The following example test uses `dig` (available in the
*bind-utils* package) in a *Vagrant* environment to show multiple answers for
the same lookup. Performing multiple pings shows the resolution swapping between
IP addresses:
