== Overview
Routers provide external DNS mapping and load balancing to services over protocols that pass distinguishing information directly to the router (HTTP, HTTPS, and TLS with SNI). Routers subscribe to a configuration and automatically update themselves with any changes, and may be containerized or virtual (converting those changes to API calls to a system like an F5).

Other capabilities exist to load-balance a service within a cluster. These services are exposed via a configurable link relation between different services, and ensure a set of services can be available. Deployments may choose to use these services as local proxies for each host, or to reuse the shared routing infrastructure.

While configuring a router is up to the OpenShift administrator, setting the route types of each individual application is up to the application developer.

== Route Types
Routes can be either secure or unsecure. Secure routes provide the ability to use different types of TLS termination to serve certificates to the client. To create a secure route, specify the TLS termination of the route in a json file.


.An unsecure route:
====

----
{
    "kind": "Route",
    "apiVersion": "v1beta1",
    "metadata": {
        "name": "route-unsecure"
    },
    "id": "route-unsecure",
    "host": "www.example.com",
    "serviceName": "hello-nginx"
}
----

====

.A secure route (using edge termination):
====

----
{
    "metadata": {
        "name": "route-edge"
    },
    "id": "route-edge",
    "apiVersion": "v1beta1",
    "kind": "Route",
    "host": "www.example.com",
    "serviceName": "hello-nginx",
    "tls": {
        "termination": "edge",
        "certificate": "CERT TEXT OMITTED FOR READABILITY",
        "key": "CERT TEXT OMITTED FOR READABILITY",
        "caCertificate": "CERT TEXT OMITTED FOR READABILITY"
     }
}
----

====

Note that while both secure and unsecure is possible with an OpenShift deployment, Red Hat recommends a secure routing service.

== Securing Routes
Creating a secure route to your pods is accomplished by specifying the TLS Termination of the route and, optionally, providing certificates. At the time of writing, OpenShift Beta 1 TLS termination relies on SNI for serving custom certificates. Any non-SNI traffic received on port 443 has TLS termination with a generic certificate. In the future, the ability to create custom frontends within the router will allow all traffic to serve custom certificates.

By default, OpenShift has no pod encryption, but can be set to any of the following three types of TLS termination:

=== Edge Termination
Edge termination is when TLS termination occurs prior to traffic reaching its destination. TLS certificates are served by the front end of the router.

Edge termination is configured by setting `tls:termination` to `edge` on your route and by specifying the `certificate`, `caCertificate`, and `key`:

----
{
    "metadata": {
        "name": "route-edge"
    },
    "id": "route-edge",
    "apiVersion": "v1beta1",
    "kind": "Route",
    "host": "www.example.com",
    "serviceName": "hello-nginx",
    "tls": {
        "termination": "edge",
        "certificate": "<Certificate_File>",
        "key": "<Key_File>",
        "caCertificate": "<CaCertificate_File>"
     }
}
----

=== Passthrough Termination
Passthrough termination is for sending encrypted traffic straight to the destination without the router providing TLS termination.

Passthrough termination is configured by setting `tls:termination` to `passthrough` on your route. No other information is required. The destination (such as an Nginx, Apache, or another HAProxy instance) is then responsible for serving certificates for the traffic:

----
{
    "metadata": {
        "name": "route-secure"
    },
    "id": "route-secure",
    "apiVersion": "v1beta1",
    "kind": "Route",
    "host": "www.example.com",
    "serviceName": "hello-nginx-secure",
    "tls": { "termination" : "passthrough" }
}
----

=== Re-encryption Termination
Re-encryption is a type of edge termination where the client encrypts communication with a certificate, which is then re-encrypted with a different certificate when the traffic reaches the destination; with the router using health checks to determine the authenticity of the host.

Re-encryption termination is configured by setting `tls:termination` to `reencrypt` and specifying the `certificate`, `key`, and `caCertificate`, as well as the `destinationCACertificate`. The edge termination certificates remain the same as in the edge termination use case. The `destinationCaCertificate` is used in order to validate the secure connection from the router to the destination, and is specific to each implemenation:

----
{
    "metadata": {
        "name": "route-reencrypt"
    },
    "id": "route-reencrypt",
    "apiVersion": "v1beta1",
    "kind": "Route",
    "host": "www.example2.com",
    "serviceName": "hello-nginx-secure",
    "tls": {
        "termination": "reencrypt",
        "certificate": "<Certificate_File>",
        "key": "<Key_File>",
        "caCertificate": "<CaCertificate_File>",
        "destinationCaCertificate": "<Destination_CaCertificate_File>"
     }
}
----

=== Special Notes About Secure Routes

At the time of writing, password protected key files are not supported. HAProxy prompts you for a password upon starting and does not have a way to automate this process. To remove a passphrase from a keyfile you can run `openssl rsa -in passwordProtectedKey.key -out new.key`

When creating a secure route you must include your certificate files as a single line of text. Replace the existing line breaks with `\\n`. Note the double slash, which is required by the json spec.


== Routers
A template router provides certain infrastructure information to the underlying router implementation, such as:

* A wrapper that watches endpoints and routes.
* Endpoint and route data, and saves it into a consumable form.
* Passing the internal state to a configurable template and executes the template.
* Calling a reload script.

Router plugins assume they can bind to host ports 80 and 443. This is to allow external traffic to route to the host and subsequently through the router. Routers also assume that networking is set up as such that it can access all pods in the cluster.

At the time of writing, a template router is the single type of router plugin available in OpenShift. 

=== The HAProxy Template Router

The HAProxy template router implementation is the reference implementation for a template router plugin. This uses `openshift/origin-haproxy-router` to run an HAProxy instance alongside the template router plugin. To test routes, an install script is provided in `hack/install-router.sh`.

The route script requires two parameters, the router ID and the full URL to the master, and attempts to create the router based on the generated json file if it can find the `osc` executable on the path. If it cannot find the executable it creates the json file and notifies the user of the location. You can then manually run the create command.

==== Data Flow

The following diagram illustrates how data flows from the master through the plugin and finally into a HAProxy configuration.

== HA Routers

Highly available router setups can be accomplished by running multiple instances of the router pod and fronting them with a balancing tier. This can be something as simple as DNS round robin or as complex as multiple load-balancing layers.

=== DNS Round Robin

As a simple example, you can create a zone file for a DNS server, such as BIND, that maps multiple A records for a single domain name. When clients do a lookup they are given one of the many records, in order, as a round robin scheme. The following examples illustrate using wild card DNS with multiple A records to achieve the desired round robin. The wild card could be further distributed into shards with `*.<shard>`. Finally, a test using `dig` (available in the `bind-utils` package) is shown from the vagrant environment that shows multiple answers for the same lookup. Doing multiple pings show the resolution swapping between IP addresses.

Add a new zone that points to your file:

----
#### named.conf 
    zone "v3.rhcloud.com" IN {
            type master;
            file "v3.rhcloud.com.zone";
    };

----
The following contains the round robin mappings for the DNS lookup:
----
#### v3.rhcloud.com.zone 
    $ORIGIN v3.rhcloud.com.

    @       IN      SOA     . v3.rhcloud.com. (
                         2009092001         ; Serial
                             604800         ; Refresh
                              86400         ; Retry
                            1206900         ; Expire
                                300 )       ; Negative Cache TTL
            IN      NS      ns1.v3.rhcloud.com.
    ns1     IN      A       127.0.0.1
    *       IN      A       10.245.2.2
            IN      A       10.245.2.3
