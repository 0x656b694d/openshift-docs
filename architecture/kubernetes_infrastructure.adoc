toc::[]

== Master

The host(s) containing the master components (API Server, Controller Manger Server, etcd, etc)

=== API Server

Serves the main API

=== Controller Manager Server

Watches etcd for changes to ReplicationController objects and then uses the API to enforce the desired state.

=== etcd

All persistent master state is stored in etcd. Other components watch etcd for changes and eventually bring themselves into the desired state described in etcd.

== Node

Each node has the services necessary to run Docker containers and be managed from the master systems

=== Kubelet

Each node has a kubelet that works in terms of a container manifest. A container manifest is a YAML file that describes a pod. The kubelet takes a set of manifests and ensures that the containers described in those manifests are started and continue running.

=== Service Proxy

Each node also runs a simple network proxy. This reflects services as defined in the API on each node and can do simple TCP and UDP stream forwarding (round robin) across a set of backends.
