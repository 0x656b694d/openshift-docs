== Overview
The OpenShift web console is a user interface accessible from a web browser.
Developers can use the web console to visualize, browse, and manage the contents
of link:../../dev_guide/projects.html[projects].

The web console is started as part of the
link:kubernetes_infrastructure.html#master[master] and by default listens one
port higher than the API server. All static assets required to run the web
console are served from the `openshift` binary.

When you access the web console from a browser, it first loads all required
static assets. It then makes requests to the OpenShift and Kubernetes APIs using
the values defined from the `openshift start` options `--public-kubernetes` and
`--public-master`, or from the related
link:../../admin_guide/master_node_configuration.html#master-configuration-files[master
configuration file parameters]. The web console uses WebSockets to maintain a
persistent connection with the API servers and receive updated information as
soon as it is available.

[NOTE]
====
JavaScript must be enabled to use the web console. For the best experience, use
a web browser that supports
link:http://caniuse.com/#feat=websockets[WebSockets].

.Web Console Request Architecture

The default host name for the web console is whitelisted to communicate with the
API server. To access the web console using a different host name, you must
whitelist that host name by specifying the `--cors-allowed-origins` option
during `openshift start`.

== Project Overviews
After link:../../dev_guide/authentication.html[logging in], the web console
provides developers with an overview for the currently selected
