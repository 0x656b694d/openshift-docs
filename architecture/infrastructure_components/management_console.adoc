== Overview
The OpenShift Management Console is a user interface accessible from a web
browser. Developers can use the Management Console to visualize, browse, and
manage the contents of link:../../dev_guide/projects.html[projects].

The Management Console is started as part of the
link:kubernetes_infrastructure.html#master[master] and by default listens one
port higher than the API server. All static assets required to run the console
are served from the `openshift` binary.

When you access the Management Console from a web browser, it first loads all
required static assets. It then makes requests to the OpenShift and Kubernetes
APIs using the values defined from the `openshift start` options
`--public-kubernetes` and `--public-master`. The Management Console uses
WebSockets to maintain a persistent connection with the API servers and receive
updated information as soon as it is available.

NOTE: JavaScript must be enabled to use the Management Console. For the best
experience, use a web browser that supports
link:http://caniuse.com/#feat=websockets[WebSockets].

The default host name for the Management Console has been whitelisted to
communicate with the API server. To access the Management Console using a
different host name, you must whitelist that host name by specifying the
`--cors-allowed-origins` option during `openshift start`.
