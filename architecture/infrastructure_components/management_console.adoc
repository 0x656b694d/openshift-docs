== Overview
The OpenShift Management Console is a user interface accessible from a browser.
Developers can link:../../dev_guide/console.html[use the Management Console] to
visualize and browse the contents of their projects.

The Management Console is started as part of the
link:kubernetes_infrastructure.html#master[master] and by default listens one
port higher than the API server. All static assets required to run the console
are served from the `openshift` binary.

When you access the console from a web browser, it first loads all required
static assets. It then makes requests to the OpenShift and Kubernetes APIs using
the values defined from the `openshift start` options `--public-kubernetes` and
`--public-master`. The console uses WebSockets to maintain a persistent
connection with the API servers and receive updated information as soon as it is
available.

NOTE: JavaScript must be enabled to use the Management Console. For the best
experience, use a web browser that supports

The default host name for the console has been whitelisted to communicate with
the API server. To access the console using a different host name, you must
whitelist that host name by specifying the `--cors-allowed-origins` option
during `openshift start`.
