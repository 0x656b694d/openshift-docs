== Overview
http://kubernetes.io[Kubernetes] is used to manage containerized applications
across a set of containers or hosts and provide deployment, maintenance, and
application-scaling mechanisms. Docker is used to package, instantiate, and run
containerized applications.

A Kubernetes cluster consists of a master and a set of nodes.

== Master
The master is the host or hosts that contain the master components, including
the API server, controller manager server, and *etcd*. The master manages
link:#node[nodes] in its Kubernetes cluster and schedules
link:../core_objects/kubernetes_model.html#pod[pods] to run on nodes.

.Master Components
|===
|Component |Description

|API Server
|The Kubernetes API server validates and configures the data for pods, services,
and replication controllers. It also assigns pods to nodes and synchronizes pod
information with service configuration.

|*etcd*
|*etcd* stores the persistent master state while other components watch *etcd*
for changes to bring themselves into the desired state.

|Controller Manager Server
|The controller manager server watches *etcd* for changes to replication
controller objects and then uses the API to enforce the desired state.

////
*API Server*

The Kubernetes API server validates and configures the data for pods, services, and replication controllers. It also assigns pods to nodes and synchronizes pod information with service configuration.

*etcd*

*etcd* stores the persistent master state while other components watch *etcd* for changes to bring themselves into the desired state.

*Controller Manager Server*

The controller manager server watches *etcd* for changes to replication controller objects and then uses the API to enforce the desired state.

[[node]]
== Node
A node provides the runtime environments for containers. Each node in a
Kubernetes cluster has the required services to be managed by the
link:#master[master]. Nodes also have the required services to run pods,
including Docker, a link:#kubelet[kubelet], and a link:#service-proxy[service
proxy].

Nodes are created from a cloud provider, or from physical or virtual systems.
Kubernetes interacts with node objects that are a representation of those nodes.
The master uses the information from node objects to validate nodes with health
checks. A node is ignored until it passes the health checks, and the master
continues checking nodes until they are valid.

See the
https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes/blob/master/docs/node.md#node-management[Kubernetes
documentation] for more information on node management.

As an OpenShift administrator, you can
link:../../admin_guide/manage_nodes.html[manage nodes] in your instance using
the CLI.

[[kubelet]]
*Kubelet*

The kubelet on each node updates the node as specified by a container manifest,
which is a YAML file that describes a pod. The kubelet uses a set of manifests
to ensure that the described containers are started and that they continue to
run. A sample manifest can be found in the
https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/containers/container_vms#container_manifest[Kubernetes
documentation].

There are a number of ways that a container manifest can be provided to a
kubelet:

- A file path on the command line that is checked every 20 seconds.
- An HTTP endpoint passed on the command line that is checked every 20 seconds.
- The kubelet watching an *etcd* server, such as *_/registry/hosts/$(hostname -f)_*, and acting on any changes.
- The kubelet listening for HTTP and responding to a simple API to submit a new
 manifest.

[[service-proxy]]
*Service Proxy*

Each node also runs a simple network proxy that reflects the services defined in
the API on that node. This allows the node to do simple TCP and UDP stream
forwarding across a set of back ends.
