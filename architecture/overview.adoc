OpenShift attempts to expose underlying Docker and Google models as accurately as possible, with a focus on easy composition of applications by a developer (install Ruby, push code, add MySQL). Unlike 2.x, more flexibility of configuration is exposed after creation in all aspects of the model. The concept of an application as a separate object is being removed in favor of more flexible composition of "services" - allowing two web containers to reuse a DB, or expose a DB directly to the edge of the network.

How it all fits together:

Docker provides the abstraction for packaging and creating Linux based lightweight containers.  Kubernetes provides the mechanism for orchestrating Docker containers on multiple hosts.  OpenShift adds the application logic for source code management, builds, deployments, users, teams, etc.
