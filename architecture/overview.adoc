OpenShift is a layered system designed to expose underlying Docker and Kubernetes concepts as accurately as possible, with a focus on easy composition of applications by a developer (install Ruby, push code, add MySQL). Unlike 2.x, more flexibility of configuration is exposed after creation in all aspects of the model. The concept of an application as a separate object is being removed in favor of more flexible composition of "services" - allowing two web containers to reuse a DB, or expose a DB directly to the edge of the network.

==== What are those layers?

Docker provides the abstraction for packaging and creating Linux based lightweight containers.  Kubernetes provides the cluster management and orchestrating Docker containers on multiple hosts.  OpenShift adds source code management, builds, and deployments for developers, and managing and promoting images at scale as they flow through your system, application management at scale, and team and user tracking for organizing a large developer organization.


==== What is the OpenShift architecture?

OpenShift is a set of microservices that can run on top of (or alongside) a Kubernetes cluster.  Data about the objects is stored in etcd - a reliable clustered key value store.  Those services are broken down by function:

* REST APIs, which expose each of the core objects.
* Controllers, which read those APIs, apply changes to other objects, and report status or write back to the object.

Users make calls to the REST API to change the state of the system.  Controllers use the REST API to read the user's desired state, and then try to bring the other parts of the system into sync.  For example, when a user requests a build they create a "Build" object.  The build controller sees that a new Build has been created, and runs a process on the cluster to perform that build.  When the build completes, the controller updates the Build object via the REST API and the user sees their build is complete.

The controller pattern means that much of the functionality in OpenShift is extensible - how builds are run and launched can be customized independent of how images are managed, or how deployments happen. The controllers are performing the "business logic" of the system - taking user actions and transforming them into reality - and so by customizing those controllers or replacing them with your own logic different behaviors can be implemented.  From a system administration perspective, this also means the API can be used to script common administrative actions on a repeating schedule.  Those scripts are also controllers - watching for changes and taking action - and OpenShift should make the ability to customize the cluster in this fashion a first class behavior.

To make this possible controllers leverage a reliable stream of changes to the system to sync their view of the world with what users are doing.  This event stream pushes changes from etcd to the REST API and then to the controllers as soon as changes occur, so changes can ripple out through the system very quickly and efficiently.  However - since failures can occur at any time - the controllers also have to be able to get the latest state of the system on startup and make sure everything is in the right state.  This reschronization is important - it means that even if something goes wrong, the operator can restart the affected components, and the system double checks everything before continuing.  The system should eventually converge to the user intent since the controllers can always bring the world into sync.
