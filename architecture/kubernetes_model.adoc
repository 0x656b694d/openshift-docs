=== ReplicationController

A Replication Controller ensures that a specific number of pods are running at all times. If a pod or host goes down, the replication controller ensures enough pods get recreated elsewhere.

== Pod

Pods map to one or more docker containers collocated on the same host.  Each pod has its own ip address and therefore owns its entire port space.  Containers within pods can also share storage.

== Label

Labels are used to organize and filter resources.

== Service

A service provides a network connection to one or more network services.

A service uses a label selector to find all the containers running which provide a certain network service on a certain port. The service is then bound to a local port. So to access the service from inside your application or container you just bind to the local network on the port number for the service.
