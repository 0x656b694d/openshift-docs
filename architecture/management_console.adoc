== Overview
The OpenShift Management Console is a web-based front end for using OpenShift.  It is started as part of the link:../installation/rpm.html#starting-the-openshift-master[master] and by default listens one port higher than the API server.  All static assets required to run the console are served from the `openshift` binary.

When a user accesses the console from their web browser it will first load all required static assets.  It will then make requests to the OpenShift and Kubernetes APIs using the values defined from the `openshift start` options `--public-kubernetes` and `--public-master`.  The console uses websockets to maintain a persistent connection with the API servers to receive updated information as soon as it is available. 

NOTE: JavaScript must be enabled to use the management console.  For the best experience use a web browser that supports link:http://caniuse.com/#feat=websockets[websockets].

The default hostname for the console has been whitelisted to communicate with the API server.  To access the console using a different hostname you will need to specify the `--cors-allowed-origins` option during `openshift start` to whitelist that hostname.
