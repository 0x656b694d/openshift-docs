== Overview
The OpenShift Management Console is a web-based front end for using OpenShift. It is started as part of the link:../architecture/kubernetes_infrastructure.html#master[master] and by default listens one port higher than the API server. All static assets required to run the console are served from the `openshift` binary.

When you access the console from a web browser, it first loads all required static assets. It then makes requests to the OpenShift and Kubernetes APIs using the values defined from the `openshift start` options [parameter]#--public-kubernetes# and [parameter]#--public-master#. The console uses websockets to maintain a persistent connection with the API servers and receive updated information as soon as it is available.

NOTE: JavaScript must be enabled to use the management console. For the best experience use a web browser that supports link:http://caniuse.com/#feat=websockets[websockets].

The default hostname for the console has been whitelisted to communicate with the API server. To access the console using a different hostname, you must whitelist that hostname by specifying the `--cors-allowed-origins` option during `openshift start`.
