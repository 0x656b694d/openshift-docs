== Overview

OpenShift utilizes any server implementing the Docker registry API as a source of images, including the canonical Docker Hub, private registries run by 3rd parties, and the integrated OpenShift registry.

=== Integrated OpenShift Registry

OpenShift provides an integrated Docker registry that adds the ability to provision new image repositories on the fly (NOTE: this isn't 100% implemented yet), so users automatically have a place for their builds to push the resulting images.

Whenever a new image is pushed to the integrated registry, the registry notifies OpenShift about the new image, passing along all the information about it (namespace, name, image metadata). Different pieces of OpenShift react to new images, creating new builds and deployments (as described elsewhere).

=== 3rd Party Registries

OpenShift can create containers using images from 3rd party registries, but these registries likely won't offer the same image notification support that the integrated OpenShift registry does. If not, OpenShift is able to poll the other registries for changes to image repositories. When new images are detected, the same build/deployment/etc reactions described above occur. (NOTE: polling is not implemented yet.)

==== Authentication

OpenShift is able to communicate with registries to access private image repositories using credentials supplied by the user. This allows OpenShift to push and pull images to/from private repositories. (NOTE: This isn't implemented yet.)
