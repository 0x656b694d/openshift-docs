== Overview
A build is the end result of transforming input parameters, typically source code, into a resulting object, typically a runnable image.

For a list of build commands, see the
link:../../dev_guide/builds.html[Developer's Guide].

== Build Strategies

There are three available link:openshift_model.html#build-strategies[build strategies]:

* link:#docker-build[Docker build]
* link:#source-build[Source-to-Image build]
* link:#custom-build[Custom build]

The resulting object depends on the builder used to create the image.

[#docker-build]
=== Docker Build
Docker builds invoke the plain https://docs.docker.com/reference/commandline/cli/#build[docker build command], and therefore expect a repository with a *_Dockerfile_* and all required directories.

[#source-build]
=== Source-to-Image Build
link:../../creating_images/sti.html[Source-to-Image (S2I)] is a tool for
building reproducible Docker images. It produces ready-to-run images by
injecting a user source into a docker image and assembling a new docker image.
The new image incorporates the base image and built source, and is ready to use
with the `docker run` command. S2I supports incremental builds, which re-use
previously downloaded dependencies, previously built artifacts, etc.

The advantages of S2I include:

[horizontal]
Image flexibility:: S2I scripts can be written to layer application code onto
almost any existing Docker image, taking advantage of the existing ecosystem.
Note that, currently, S2I relies on `tar` to inject application
source, so the image needs to be able to process tarred content.

Speed:: With S2I, the assemble process can perform a large number of complex
operations without creating a new layer at each step, resulting in a fast
process. In addition, S2I scripts can be written to re-use artifacts stored in a
previous version of the application image rather than having to download or
build them each time the build is run.

Patchability:: S2I allows you to rebuild the application consistently if an
underlying image needs a patch due to a security issue.

Operational efficiency:: By restricting build operations instead of allowing
arbitrary actions, such as in a *_Dockerfile_*, the PaaS operator can avoid
accidental or intentional abuses of the build system.

Operational security:: Building an arbitrary *_Dockerfile_* exposes the host
system to root privilege escalation. This can be exploited by a malicious user
because the entire docker build process is run as a user with docker privileges.
S2I restricts the operations performed as a root user, and can run the scripts
as an non-root user.

User efficiency:: S2I prevents developers from performing arbitrary `yum
install` type operations during their application build, which results in slow
development iteration.

Ecosystem:: S2I encourages a shared ecosystem of images where you can leverage
best practices for your applications.

[#custom-build]
=== Custom Build
Custom builds allow developers to define the specific builder image responsible
for the entire build process. The custom builder image is a plain Docker image
with embedded build process logic, such as building RPMs or building base Docker
images.
