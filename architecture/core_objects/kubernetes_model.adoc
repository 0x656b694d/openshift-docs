== Pod

In a Kubernetes environment, a pod is a group of shared Docker containers on a
host, and the smallest deployable unit that can be created, scheduled, and
managed.

Each pod has its own IP address, therefore owning its entire port space, and
containers within pods can share storage. Pods can be "tagged" with one or more
labels, which are then used to select and manage groups of pods in a single
operation.

The following JSON example was retrieved from an OpenShift system by running:

****
`osc get pods/_<pod_id>_`

====
<1> The labels are stored in key/value format in the `annotation` hash. The
label in this example is `deployment=docker-registry-1`.
<2> The Docker image(s) that define the pod are provided in the `containers`
list along with related environment variable mappings.

== Label

Labels are used to organize, group, or select objects and resources, such as
pods. Pods are "tagged" with labels, and then services and replication
controllers use labels to indicate the pods they relate to. This makes it
possible for services and replication controllers to reference groups of pods,
or treat pods with potentially different Docker containers as similar entities.

Labels are a Key/Value pair, and shown in the following example:

====

----

"labels": {
  "key1" : "value1",
  "key2" : "value2"
}
----

====

Consider:

* A pod consisting of an nginx Docker container, with the label "role=webserver"
* A pod consisting of an Apache Docker container, with the same label
* "role=webserver"

A service or replication controller that is defined to use pods with the
"role=webserver" label treats both of these pods as part of the same group.

For more information on labels, see the
https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes/blob/master/docs/labels.md[Kubernetes
documentation].

== Replication Controller

A replication controller ensures that a specific number of pods set with a
particular label are running at all times. If one of the matching pods or a
Kubernetes host goes down, the replication controller re-instantiates matching
pods up to the defined number across the cluster. Likewise, if there are too
many running pods, it kills the required amount of hosts. Any new pods are
created by the template set in the replication controller object.

The replication controller does not perform auto-scaling; rather, it is
controlled by an external auto-scaler, which changes the `replicas` field.
Replication controllers are only appropriate for pods with `RestartPolicy =
Always`, and a pod with a different restart policy is refused.

The most important elements in the JSON structure of a replication controller
object are the `replicas` and `replicaSelector` values, as shown in the
following example:

====

----
{
    "kind": "ReplicationControllerList",
    "creationTimestamp": null,
    "selfLink": "/api/v1beta1/replicationControllers",
    "resourceVersion": 27,
    "apiVersion": "v1beta1",
    "items": [
        {
            "id": "docker-registry-1",
            "uid": "7fa58610-9b31-11e4-9dff-f0def1de880f",
            "creationTimestamp": "2015-01-13T09:36:02-05:00",
            "selfLink": "/api/v1beta1/replicationControllers/docker-registry-1?namespace=default",
            "resourceVersion": 26,
            "namespace": "default",
            "annotations": {
                ...
            },
            "desiredState": {
                "replicas": 1, <1>
                "replicaSelector": {
                    "name": "registrypod" <2>
                },
----

====

<1> The number of copies of the pod to run.
<2> The label selector of the pod to run.

These determine which pods to maintain.

For more on replication controllers, see the
https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes/blob/master/docs/replication-controller.md[Kubernetes
documentation].

== Service

A service identifies a set of link:#pod[pods] and proxies the connections it
receives to them. Pods can be added or taken away from a service any number of
times.

Services assign clients an IP address and port pair that, when accessed,
redirect to the appropriate back end. A service uses a label selector to find
all the containers running that provide a certain network service on a certain
port. The service is then bound to a local port, so to access the service from
inside your application or container you simply bind to the local network on the
port number for the service.

Like pods, services are REST objects. To create a new service, a service
definition can be sent to the API server using a POST operation. The following
example shows the definition of a service with a name of `frontend`, which
forwards to container TCP port `8080` on any pod with the `name=frontend` label
attached:

documentation] for more on services.

== Namespace

A single cluster should be able to satisfy the needs of multiple user
communities. Each user community wants to be able to work in isolation from
other communities. Each user community has its own:

[horizontal]
Resources:: pods, services, replication controllers
Policies:: who can or cannot perform actions in their community
Constraints:: quota for this community

A cluster operator may create a Namespace for each unique user community.
The Namespace provides a unique scope for:

* Named resources to avoid basic naming collisions
* Delegated management authority to trusted users
* Ability to limit community resource consumption

A namespace provides a mechanism to subdivide resources in a Kubernetes cluster.

The
https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes/blob/master/docs/namespaces.md[Kubernetes
documentation] has more information on namespaces.

== LimitRange

A limit range provides a mechanism to enforce min/max limits placed on resources
in a Kubernetes namespace.

By adding a limit range to your namespace, you can enforce the minimum and
maximum amount of CPU and Memory consumed by an individual pod or container.

Under active development, refer to
https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes/blob/master/docs/design/admission_control_limit_range.md

== ResourceQuota

Kubernetes can limit both the number of objects created in a Namespace, and the
total amount of resources requested across objects in a namespace.  This
facilitates sharing of a single Kubernetes cluster by several teams, each in a
namespace, as a mechanism of preventing one team from starving another team of
cluster resources.

The
https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes/blob/master/docs/resource_quota_admin.md[Kubernetes
documentation] has more information on ResourceQuota.

== Resource

A Kubernetes Resource is something that can be requested by, allocated to, or
consumed by a pod or container. Examples include memory (RAM), CPU, disk-time,
and network bandwidth.
https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes/blob/master/docs/resources.md[Kubernetes
docs]

== Secret

Storage for keys, passwords, certificates, and such which is accessible by the
intended pod(s) but held separately from their definitions. Under active
development.

== PersistentVolume

A PersistentVolume is a resource in the infrastructure provisioned by the cluster administrator.  PVs provide
durable storage for stateful applications.
https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes/blob/master/docs/design/persistent-storage.md[Kubernetes docs]

== PersistentVolumeClaim

A PersistentVolumeClaim is a request for storage by a pod author.  Kubernetes matches the claim against the pool of
available volumes and binds them together.  The claim is then used as a volume by a pod.  Kubernetes makes sure the
volume is available on the same node as the pod that requires it.
https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes/blob/master/docs/design/persistent-storage.md[Kubernetes docs]
