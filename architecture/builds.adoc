== Overview
A build is a process of transforming input parameters, typically source code, into a resulting object, typically a runnable image.

== BuildConfig
The `BuildConfig` object is the definition of the entire build process. It consists of the following elements:

* _triggers_: Define policies used for automatically invoking builds.
** _GitHub webhooks_: GitHub specific webhooks that specify which repository changes, such as a new commit, should invoke a new build. This trigger is specific to the GitHub API.
** _generic webhooks_: Similar to GitHub webhooks in that they invoke a new build whenever it gets a notification. The difference is its payload is slightly different than GitHub's.
** _image change_: Defines a trigger which is invoked upon availability of a new image in the specified ImageRepository.
* _parameters_
** _source_: Describes the SCM used to locate the sources. Currently only supports Git.
** _strategy_: Describes which build type is invoked along with build type specific details.
** _output_: Describes the resulting image name, tag, and registry to which the image should be pushed.

There are three available link:openshift_model.html#build-strategies[build strategies]:

* link:#docker-build[Docker build]
* link:#sti-build[STI build]
* link:#custom-build[Custom build]

The resulting object depends on which builder is used to create the image.

[#docker-build]
== Docker Build
Docker builds invoke the plain https://docs.docker.com/reference/commandline/cli/#build[docker build] command, and therefore expect a repository with a `Dockerfile` and all required directories.

[#sti-build]
== STI Build
STI builds are a replacement for the OpenShift v2-like developer experience. The developer specifies the repository where their project is located and a builder image, which defines the language and framework used for writing their application. STI then assembles a new image which runs the application defined by the source using the framework defined by the builder image.

[#custom-build]
== Custom Build
Custom builds are the most sophisticated version of builds, allowing developers to define a builder image which is responsible for the entire process of the build. The custom builder image is a plain Docker image within which the author embeds the logic of the desired build process, such as building RPMs or building
base Docker images.

== Using Docker credentials for pushing images

In case you want to push the output image into private Docker Registry that
requires authentication or Docker Hub, you have to supply the `.dockercfg` file
with valid Docker Registry credentials.

The `.dockercfg` JSON file usually exists in your home directory and it has following
format:

```
{"https://index.docker.io/v1/":{"auth":"encrypted_password","email":"foo@bar.com"}}
```

You can also add authentication entries to this file by running `docker login`
command. The file will be created if it does not exist.

The 'https://index.docker.io/v1' is the URL of the registry. You can define
multiple Docker registries entries in this file.

Kubernetes provides the https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes/blob/master/docs/design/secrets.md[Secret]
resource, which you can use to store your passwords and configuration.
In order to make Build use your `.dockercfg` file for pushing the output image,
you have to create the Secret first. The 'data' field in Secret must contain the
'dockercfg' key with the value set to base64 encoded content of the '.dockercfg'
file. For example:

```
{
  "apiVersion": "v1beta3",
  "kind": "Secret",
  "metadata": {
    "name": "dockerhub"
  },
  "data": {
    "dockercfg": "6yJodHRwc1ovL2zuZGV4LmRvY21lci5aby92MS8iOnsiYXV0aCI6ImJXWnZhblJwYXpwdVoybGxkR2d4TUE9PSIsImVtYWlsIj8ibWlAbWlmby5zayJ9fQ=="
  }
}

```

To create the secret, you can use 'osc create -f secret.json'. Once you have
this secret created, you can add `PushSecretName` field into `Output` section
inside the BuildConfig and set it to the name of the Secret that you created (in
this case 'dockerhub').
