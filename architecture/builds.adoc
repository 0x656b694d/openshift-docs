== Overview
A build is a process of transforming input parameters, typically source code into resulting object,
typically a runnable image.

== BuildConfig
`BuildConfig` object is the definition of the entire build process. It consists of
following elements:
* triggers - defines policies used for automatic invoking builds
  * github webhook - github specific webhook, specifies which repository changes should
    invoke new build, eg. each new commit triggers a new build. This trigger
    is specific to the github API.
  * generic webhook - generic webhook is similar to github webhook in that it
    invokes a new build whenever it gets a notification. The difference is its payload
    which is slightly different than github's.
  * image change - defines a trigger which will be invoked upon availability of
    a new image in specified `ImageRepository`.
* parameters
  * source - describes the SCM used to locate the sources, currently only GIT is supported
  * strategy - describes which build type will be invoked along with build type
    specific details
  * output - describes the resulting image name, tag and registry to which the
    image should be pushed


Since the resulting object depends on the builder used for creating the image we've
defined the following three strategies:
* link:[#Docker build]
* link:[#STI build]
* link:[#Custom build]

== Docker build
Docker build invokes plain https://docs.docker.com/reference/commandline/cli/#build[docker build],
thus it expects a repository with a `Dockerfile` and all the necessary directories.

== STI build
STI build is a replacement for the v2 like user experience, meaning the user specifies the repository
where his project is located and a builder image, which defines the language and framework used for writing
his application. STI will then assemble a new image which runs the application defined by the source
using the framework defined by the builder image.

== Custom build
Custom build is the most sophisticated version of builds, allowing users to define a builder image which
is responsible for the entire process of the build. The custom builder image is a plain docker image
within which author embeds the logic of the desired build process, eg. building rpms, building
base docker images, etc.
