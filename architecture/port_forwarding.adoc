== Overview

OpenShift takes advantage of a feature built into Kubernetes to support executing commands in containers. This is implemented using HTTP along with a multiplexed streaming protocol such as link:http://www.chromium.org/spdy[SPDY] or link:https://http2.github.io/[HTTP/2].

=== Client Operation

==== CLI

Support for port forwarding is built into `kubectl`:

----
kubectl port-forward <pod> <container> <port> [<port>...]
----

Kubectl listens on each port specified by the user, forwarding via the following protocol.

==== Protocol

Clients initiate the execution of a remote command in a container by issuing a request to the Kubernetes API Server:

----
/proxy/minions/node123.openshift.com/portForward/myns/mypod/mycontainer
----

In the above URL:

* `node123.openshift.com` is the node name
* `myns` is the target pod's namespace
* `mypod` is the target pod's name
* `mycontainer` is the target container's name

After sending a port forward request to the API Server, the client upgrades the connection to one that supports multiplexed streams; the current implementation uses SPDY.

The client creates a stream with the `port` header containing the target port in the container. All data written to the stream is delivered via the Kubelet to the target container and port. Similarly, all data sent from the container for that forwarded connection is delivered back to the same stream in the client.

The client should close all streams, the upgraded connection, and the underlying connection when it is finished with the port forwarding request.

=== Server Operation

The Kubelet is responsible for handling port forward requests from clients. Upon receiving a request, it upgrades the response and waits for the client to create port forwarding streams. When it receives a new stream, it copies data between the stream and the container's port.

==== Forwarding to a container's port

There are a few different options for forwarding to a container's port. The current implementation invokes `nsenter` directly on the host (node) to enter the container's network namespace and invoke `socat` to copy data between the stream and the container's port. Other options include running a "helper" container that then runs `nsenter` and `socat` so those binaries aren't required to be installed on the host.
