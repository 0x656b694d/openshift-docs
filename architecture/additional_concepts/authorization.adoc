== Overview
Authorization policies determine whether a user is allowed to perform a given
link:#action[action] within a project. This allows platform administrators to
use the link:#cluster-policy-and-local-policy[cluster policy] to control who has
various access levels to the OpenShift platform itself and all projects. It also
allows developers to use link:#cluster-policy-and-local-policy[local policy] to
control who has access to their link:../../dev_guide/projects.html[projects].
Note that authorization is a separate step from
link:authentication.html[authentication], which is more about determining the
identity of who is taking the action.

Authorization is managed using:

[cols="1,7"]
|===

|[[rules-def]]*Rules* |Sets of permitted link:#action[verbs] on a set of
link:../core_objects/overview.html[resources]. For example, whether something
can `create` pods.

|[[roles-def]]*Roles* |Collections of rules.
link:authentication.html#users-and-groups[Users and groups] can be associated
with, or _bound_ to, multiple link:#roles[roles] at the same time.

|[[bindings]]*Bindings* |Associations between users and/or groups with a
link:#roles[role].

|===

Rules, roles, and bindings can be visualized
link:../../admin_guide/manage_authorization_policy.html#viewing-roles-and-bindings[using
the CLI]. For example, consider the following excerpt from
link:../../admin_guide/manage_authorization_policy.html#viewing-roles-and-bindings[viewing
a policy], showing rule sets for the *admin* and *basic-user*
link:#roles[default roles]:

====

The following excerpt from

== Evaluating Authorization

Several factors are combined to make the decision when OpenShift evaluates
authorization:

[cols="1,7"]
|===

|[[identity]]*Identity* |In the context of authorization, both the user name and
list of groups the user belongs to.

|[[action]]*Action* a|The action being performed. In most cases, this consists of:

[horizontal]
Project:: The link:../../dev_guide/projects.html[project] being accessed.
Verb:: Can be `get`, `list`, `create`, `update`, or others.
Resource Name:: The API endpoint being accessed.

|*Bindings* |The full list of link:#bindings[bindings].

|===

OpenShift evaluates authorizations using the following steps:

. The identity and the project-scoped action is used to find all bindings that
apply to the user or their groups.
. Bindings are used to locate all the roles that apply.
. Roles are used to find all the rules that apply.
. The action is checked against each rule to find a match.
. If no matching rule is found, the action is then denied by default.

== Cluster Policy and Local Policy
There are two levels of authorization policy:

[cols="1,4"]
|===

|*Cluster policy* |link:#roles[Roles] and bindings that are applicable across
all projects. Roles that exist in the cluster policy are considered _cluster
roles_. Cluster bindings can only reference cluster roles.

|*Local policy* |link:#roles[Roles] and bindings that are scoped to a given
project. Roles that exist only in a local policy are considered _local roles_.
Local bindings can reference both cluster and local roles.

|===

This two-level hierarchy allows re-usability over multiple projects through the
cluster policy while allowing customization inside of individual projects
through local policies.

During evaluation, both the cluster bindings and the local bindings are used.
For example:

. Cluster-wide "allow" rules are checked.
. Locally-bound "allow" rules are checked.
. Deny by default.

== Roles
Roles are collections of policy link:#rules-def[rules], which are sets of
permitted verbs that can be performed on a set of resources. OpenShift includes
a set of default roles that can be added to users and groups in the
link:#cluster-policy-and-local-policy[cluster policy] or in a
link:#cluster-policy-and-local-policy[local policy].

[cols="1,4",options="header"]
|===

|Default Role |Description

|*admin* |A project manager. If used in a
link:#cluster-policy-and-local-policy[local binding], an *admin* user will have
rights to view any resource in the project and modify any resource in the
project except for role creation and quota. If the *cluster-admin* wants to
allow an *admin* to modify roles, the *cluster-admin* must create a
project-scoped `*Policy*` object using JSON.

|*basic-user* |A user that can get basic information about projects and users.

|*cluster-admin* |A super-user that can perform any action in any project. When
granted to a user within a local policy, they have full control over quota and
roles and every action on every resource in the project.

|*cluster-status* |A user that can get basic cluster status information.

|*edit* |A user that can modify most objects in a project, but does not have the
power to view or modify roles or bindings.

|*self-provisioner* |A user that can create their own projects.

|*view* |A user who cannot make any modifications, but can see most objects in a
project. They cannot view or modify roles or bindings.

|===

TIP: Remember that link:authentication.html#users-and-groups[users
and groups] can be associated with, or _bound_ to, multiple roles at the same
time.

These roles, including a matrix of the verbs and resources each are associated
with, can be visualized in the cluster policy by using the CLI to
link:../../admin_guide/manage_authorization_policy.html#viewing-cluster-roles[view
the cluster roles]. Additional *+++system:*+++* roles are listed as well, which
are used for various OpenShift system and component operations.

By default in a local policy, only the binding for the *admin* role is
immediately listed when using the CLI to
link:../../admin_guide/manage_authorization_policy.html#viewing-local-bindings[view
local bindings]. However, if other default roles are added to users and groups
within a local policy, they become listed in the CLI output, as well.

If you find that these roles do not suit you, a *cluster-admin* user can create
a `*policyBinding*` object named `_<projectname>_:default` with the CLI using a
JSON file. This allows the project *admin* to bind users to roles that are
defined only in the `_<projectname>_` local policy.
