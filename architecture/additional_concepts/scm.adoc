== Overview
OpenShift takes advantage of preexisting source control management (SCM) systems
either hosted internally (in-house git server) or externally (eg. https://github.com/[GitHub],
https://bitbucket.org/[Bitbucket], etc.), although initially supporting only
https://git-scm.com/[Git] solutions.

SCM integration is tightly coupled with link:../core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.html[builds],
the two points being:

- Creating a BuildConfig using a repository, which allows building your application
inside of OpenShift. You can create such `*BuildConfig*` link:../../dev_guide/builds.html#defining-a-buildconfig[manually]
or let OpenShift create it link:../../dev_guide/new_app.html[automatically] by inspecting your repository.
- link:../../dev_guide/builds.html#webhook-triggers[Triggering a Build] upon repository changes.
