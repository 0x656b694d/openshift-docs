== Overview

The authentication layer is responsible for identifying the user associated with requests to the OpenShift API. Information about the requesting user is then used by the authorization layer to determine whether the request should be allowed.

== API Authentication

Requests to the OpenShift API are authenticated using the following methods:

* OAuth Access Tokens
** Obtained from the OpenShift OAuth server using the `<master>/oauth/authorize` and `<master>/oauth/token` endpoints
** Sent as an "Authorization: Bearer &hellip;" header or an "access_token=&hellip;" query parameter
* X.509 Client Certificates
** Requires a https connection to the API server
** Verified by the API server against a trusted certificate authority bundle
** The API server creates and distributes certificates to controllers to authenticate themselves

Any request with an invalid access token or an invalid certificate is rejected by the authentication layer with a 401 error.

If no access token or certificate is presented, the authentication layer assigns the `system:anonymous` user and the `system:unauthenticated` group to the request. This allows the authorization layer to determine which requests (if any) an anonymous user is allowed to make.

== OAuth overview

The OpenShift master includes a built-in OAuth server. End-users obtain OAuth access tokens to authenticate themselves to the API.

When a person requests a new OAuth token, the OAuth server uses the configured identity provider(s) to determine the identity of the person making the request.

It then determines what user that identity maps to, creates an access token for that user, and returns the token for use.

=== OAuth clients

Every request for an OAuth token must specify the OAuth client which will receive and use the token. The following OAuth clients are automatically created when starting the OpenShift API:

 * `openshift-web-console`: used to request tokens for the web console
 * `openshift-browser-client`: used to request tokens at `<master>/oauth/token/request` with a user-agent that can handle interactive logins
 * `openshift-challenging-client`: used to request tokens with a user-agent that can handle `WWW-Authenticate` challenges

To register additional clients:
====
----
osc create -f <(echo '
{
    "kind": "OAuthClient",
    "version": "v1beta1",
    "metadata": {
        "name":"demo" <1>
    },
    "secret": "...", <2>
    "redirectURIs": [
        "http://www.example.com/" <3>
    ]
}')
----
<1> The `name` of the OAuth client is used as the `client_id` parameter when making requests to `<master>/oauth/authorize` and `<master>/oauth/token`.
<2> The `secret` is used as the `client_secret` parameter when making requests to `<master>/oauth/token`.
<3> The `redirect_uri` parameter specified in requests to `<master>/oauth/authorize` and `<master>/oauth/token` must be equal to (or prefixed by) one of the URIs in `redirectURIs`.
====

=== Integrations

All requests for OAuth tokens involve a request to `<master>/oauth/authorize`. Most authentication integrations will place an authenticating proxy in front of this endpoint, or configure OpenShift to validate credentials against a backing identity provider.

Because requests to `<master>/oauth/authorize` can come from user-agents that cannot display interactive login pages (like `osc`), authenticating using a `WWW-Authenticate` challenge is supported in addition to interactive login flows.

If an authenticating proxy is placed in front of the `<master>/oauth/authorize` endpoint, it should send unauthenticated non-browser user-agents `WWW-Authenticate` challenges, rather than displaying an interactive login page or redirecting to an interactive login flow.

If the authenticating proxy cannot support `WWW-Authenticate` challenges (or if OpenShift is configured to use an identity provider that does not support WWW-Authenticate challenges), users can visit `<master>/oauth/token/request` using a browser to obtain an access token manually.

== OAuth configuration

OAuth configuration is specified in the master config file.

When running without a master config file, the `AllowAllPasswordIdentityProvider` identity provider is used, which allows any non-empty username and password to log in. This is useful for test purposes.

To use other identity providers, you must run from a config file. For more information about creating and running from config files, see link:../using_openshift/master_node_configuration.html[Master and Node Configuration].

=== Identity providers

==== Allow All [[AllowAllPasswordIdentityProvider]]

`AllowAllPasswordIdentityProvider` allows any non-empty login and password. This is the default identity provider when running OpenShift without a config file.

Master config:
====
----
oauthConfig:
  ...
  identityProviders:
  - name: my_allow_provider <1>
    challenge: true <2>
    login: true <3>

      kind: AllowAllPasswordIdentityProvider
----
<1> This provider name is prefixed to logins to form an identity name.
<2> When `true`, unauthenticated token requests from non-web clients (like `osc`) will be sent a WWW-Authenticate challenge header for this provider.
<3> When `true`, unauthenticated token requests from web clients (like the web console) will be redirected to a login page backed by this provider.
====

==== Deny All [[DenyAllPasswordIdentityProvider]]

`DenyAllPasswordIdentityProvider` denies all username and passwords.

Master config:
====
----
oauthConfig:
  ...
  identityProviders:

====

==== HTPasswd [[HTPasswdPasswordIdentityProvider]]

`HTPasswdPasswordIdentityProvider` validates logins and passwords against a flat-file generated using http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/programs/htpasswd.html[htpasswd]

* Only MD5 and SHA encryption types are supported. MD5 encryption is recommended, and is the default for htpasswd. Plaintext, crypt, and bcrypt hashes are not currently supported.
* The file is re-read if its modification time changes, without requiring a server restart
* To create the file: `htpasswd -c </path/to/users.htpasswd> <login>`
* To add or update a login to the file: `htpasswd </path/to/users.htpasswd> <login>`
* To remove a login from the file: `htpasswd </path/to/users.htpasswd> -D <login>`

Master config:
====
----
oauthConfig:
  ...
  identityProviders:
  - name: my_htpasswd_provider <1>
    challenge: true <2>

<4> File generated using http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/programs/htpasswd.html[htpasswd].
====

==== Basic-Auth (remote) [[BasicAuthPasswordIdentityProvider]]

`BasicAuthPasswordIdentityProvider` validates logins and passwords against a remote server using a server-to-server basic-auth request.

* Logins and passwords are validated against a basic-auth protected, JSON-returning remote URL
* A 401 response indicates failed auth.
* A non-200 status, or the presence of a non-empty "error" key, indicates an error: `{"error":"Error message"}`
* A 200 status with an "id" key indicates success: `{"id":"userid"}`
** The id must be unique to the authenticated user
** The id must not be able to be modified
* A successful response may optionally provide additional data:
** Display name. Example: `{"id":"userid", "name": "User Name", ...}`
** Email address. Example: `{"id":"userid", "email":"user@example.com", ...}`
** Preferred login. This is useful when the unique, unchangeable user id is a database key or UID, and a more human-readable name exists. This is used as a hint when provisioning the OpenShift user for the authenticated identity. Example: `{"id":"014fbff9a07c", "login":"bob", ...}`

Master config:
====
----
oauthConfig:
  ...
  identityProviders:
  - name: my_remote_basic_auth_provider <1>

<2> When `true`, unauthenticated token requests from non-web clients (like `osc`) will be sent a WWW-Authenticate challenge header for this provider.
<3> When `true`, unauthenticated token requests from web clients (like the web console) will be redirected to a login page backed by this provider.
<4> URL accepting credentials in basic-auth headers.
<5> Certificate bundle to use to validate server certificates for the configured URL. Optional.
<6> Client certificate to present when making requests to the configured URL. Optional.
<7> Key for the client certificate. Required if `certFile` is specified.
====

==== Request Header [[RequestHeaderIdentityProvider]]

`RequestHeaderIdentityProvider` identifies users from request header values, like `X-Remote-User`. It is typically used in combination with an authenticating proxy, which sets the request header value.

Master config:
====
----
oauthConfig:
  ...
  identityProviders:
  - name: my_request_header_provider <1>
    challenge: false <2>
    login: false <3>
    provider:
      apiVersion: v1
      kind: RequestHeaderIdentityProvider
      clientCA: /path/to/client-ca.file <4>
      headers: <5>
      - X-Remote-User
      - SSO-User
----
<1> This provider name is prefixed to the user id in the request header to form an identity name.
<2> `RequestHeaderIdentityProvider` cannot be used to send WWW-Authenticate challenges.
<3> `RequestHeaderIdentityProvider` cannot be used to back a login page.
<4> PEM-encoded certificate bundle. If set, a valid client certificate must be presented and validated against the certificate authorities in the specified file before the request headers are checked for usernames. Optional.
<5> Header names to check, in order, for user ids. The first header containing a value is used as the user id. Required, case-insensitive.
====

==== GitHub [[GitHub]]

`GitHubIdentityProvider` uses GitHub as an identity provider, using the OAuth integration.

Note that using GitHub as an identity provider requires users to get a token using `<master>/oauth/token/request` to use with command-line tools.

Master config:
====
----
oauthConfig:
  ...
  identityProviders:
  - name: github <1>
    challenge: false <2>
    login: true <3>

      kind: GitHubIdentityProvider
      clientID: ... <4>
      clientSecret: ... <5>
----
<1> This provider name is prefixed to the GitHub numeric user id to form an identity name. It is also used to build the callback URL.
<2> `GitHubIdentityProvider` cannot be used to send WWW-Authenticate challenges.
<3> When `true`, unauthenticated token requests from web clients (like the web console) will be redirected to GitHub to log in.
<4> The client id of a link:https://github.com/settings/applications/new[registered GitHub OAuth application]. The application must be configured with a callback URL of `<master>/oauth2callback/<identityProviderName>`
<5> The client secret issued by GitHub.
====

==== Google [[Google]]

`GoogleIdentityProvider` uses Google as an identity provider, using Google's OpenID Connect integration.

See https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OpenIDConnect for more information.

Note that using Google as an identity provider requires users to get a token using `<master>/oauth/token/request` to use with command-line tools.

Master config:
====
----
oauthConfig:
  ...
  identityProviders:
  - name: google <1>
    challenge: false <2>
    login: true <3>
    provider:
      apiVersion: v1
      kind: GoogleIdentityProvider
      clientID: ... <4>
      clientSecret: ... <5>
----
<1> This provider name is prefixed to the Google numeric user id to form an identity name. It is also used to build the redirect URL.
<2> `GoogleIdentityProvider` cannot be used to send WWW-Authenticate challenges.
<3> When `true`, unauthenticated token requests from web clients (like the web console) will be redirected to Google to log in.
<4> The client id of a link:https://console.developers.google.com/[registered Google project]. The project must be configured with a redirect URI of `<master>/oauth2callback/<identityProviderName>`
<5> The client secret issued by Google.
====

==== OpenID Connect [[OpenID]]

`OpenIDIdentityProvider` integrates with an OpenID Connect identity provider, using an link:http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#CodeFlowAuth[Authorization Code Flow].

ID Token and UserInfo decryption is not supported.

By default, the `openid` scope is requested. Extra scopes (if needed) can be specified in the `extraScopes` config field.

Claims are read from the JWT `id_token` returned from the OpenID identity provider (and from the JSON returned by the `UserInfo` URL, if specified).

At least one claim must be configured as the claim to use as the user's identity. The link:http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#StandardClaims[standard identity claim] is `sub`.

You can also indicate which claims to use as the user's preferred username, display name, and email address. If multiple claims are specified, the first one with a non-empty value is used. The link:http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#StandardClaims[standard claims] are:

* `sub` (used as the user identity)
* `preferred_username` (used as the preferred user name when provisioning a user)
* `email` (email address)
* `name` (display name)

Note that using an OpenID Connect identity provider requires users to get a token using `<master>/oauth/token/request` to use with command-line tools.

Standard config:

====

=== Token options

The OAuth server generates two kinds of tokens. 

Authorize codes are short-lived tokens whose only use is to be exchanged for an access token. Set `authorizeTokenMaxAgeSeconds` to control the lifetime of authorize codes. The default lifetime is 5 minutes.

Access tokens are longer-lived tokens that grant access to the API. Set `accessTokenMaxAgeSeconds` to control the lifetime of access tokens. The default lifetime is 1 hour.

Master config:
----
oauthConfig:
  ...
  tokenConfig:
    accessTokenMaxAgeSeconds: 3600
    authorizeTokenMaxAgeSeconds: 300
----

=== Grant options

To configure how the OAuth server responds to token requests for a client the user has not previously granted permission, set the `method` value in the `grantConfig` stanza. Valid values are:

* `auto`
** Auto-approve the grant and retry the request
* `prompt`
** Prompt the user to approve or deny the grant
* `deny`
** Auto-deny the grant and return a failure error to the client

Master config:
----
oauthConfig:
  ...
  grantConfig:
    method: auto
----

=== Session options

The OAuth server uses a signed and encrypted cookie-based session during login and redirect flows.

If no `sessionSecretsFile` is specified, a random signing and encryption secret is generated at each start of the master server. This means that any logins in progress will have their sessions invalidated if the master is restarted. It also means that if multiple masters are configured, they will not be able to decode sessions generated by one of the other masters.

To specify the signing and encryption secret to use, specify a `sessionSecretsFile`. This allows you separate secret values from the config file, and keep the config file distributable for debugging, etc.

Master config:
====
----
oauthConfig:
  ...
  sessionConfig:
    sessionMaxAgeSeconds: 300 <1>
    sessionName: ssn <2>
    sessionSecretsFile: "..." <3>
----
<1> Controls the maximum age of a session (sessions auto-expire once a token request is complete). If auto-grant is not enabled, sessions must last as long as the user is expected to take to approve or reject a client authorization request.
<2> Name of the cookie used to store the session.
<3> Filename containing serialized SessionSecrets object. If empty, a random signing and encryption secret is generated at each server start.
====

Multiple secrets can be specified in the `sessionSecretsFile` to enable rotation. New sessions are signed and encrypted using the first secret in the list. Existing sessions are decrypted/authenticated by each secret until one succeeds.

Session secret config:
====
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: SessionSecrets
secrets: <1>
- authentication: "..." <2>
  encryption: "..." <3>
- authentication: "..."
  encryption: "..."
...
----
<1> List of secrets used to authenticate and encrypt cookie sessions. At least one secret must be specified. Each secret must set an authentication and encryption secret.
<2> Signing secret, used to authenticate sessions using HMAC. Recommended to use a secret with 32 or 64 bytes.
<3> Encrypting secret, used to encrypt sessions. Must be 16, 24, or 32 characters long, to select AES-128, AES-192, or AES-256.
