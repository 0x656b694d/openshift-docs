= Release Notes for Red Hat {ServerlessProductName} Technology Preview 1.5.0

[id="new-features-1-5-0_{context}"]
== New features
* {ServerlessProductName} 1.5.0 is available on {product-title} 4.3 and newer versions.
* {ServerlessProductName} now uses Knative Serving 0.12.1.
* {ServerlessProductName} now uses Knative `kn` CLI 0.12.0.
* {ServerlessProductName} now uses Knative Serving Operator 0.12.1.
* {ServerlessProductName} ingress implementation was updated to use Kourier in place of Service Mesh. No user intervention is necessary, as this change is automatic when the {ServerlessOperatorName} is upgraded to 1.5.0.

[id="fixed-issues-1-5-0_{context}"]
== Fixed issues
* In previous releases, {product-title} scale from zero latency caused a delay of approximately 10 seconds when creating pods. This issue was fixed in the {product-title} 4.3.5 bug fix update.

[id="known-issues-1-5-0_{context}"]
== Known issues
* Deleting `KnativeServing.operator.knative.dev` from the `knative-serving` namespace may cause the deletion process to hang. This is due to a race condition between deletion of the CRD and `knative-openshift-ingress` removing finalizers.
