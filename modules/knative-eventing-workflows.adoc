= Knative Eventing workflows

In a Knative Eventing workflow, event producers send information to an _event source_ about changes to system state. Examples of event producers include a Kafka cluster or the Kubernetes API server.

An _event source_ is a resource object, which is the link between an event producer and a _sink_, or consumer, that receives those events.

Examples of sinks are Knative services and channels. Events can also be sent to a _broker_, where they can be filtered using _triggers_ before being sent to a sink.
Using the broker and trigger together enables an event delivery mechanism that hides the details of event routing from the event producer and event consumer.
