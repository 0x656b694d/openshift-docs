= Prerequisites for importing a virtual machine into {VirtProductName}

ifdef::virt-importing-rhv-vm[]
Importing a Red Hat Virtualization virtual machine into {VirtProductName} has the following prerequisites:

* If the operating system of the virtual machine does not map to a common {VirtProductName} template, you must create a custom ConfigMap to map the operating system to a common {VirtProductName} template.

* If you are importing a VM with a Windows operating system, you must create a Windows {VirtProductName} template and a custom ConfigMap.

* The default storage class must be NFS.

* You must ensure that the RHV VM meets the following prerequisites:

** Network:

*** The VM network must be mapped to a single network in the {product-title} environment. The networks must either have the same name or be mapped to each other.
*** The network interface must be `e1000`, `rtl8139`, or `virtio`.

** Disk:

*** The disk interface must be `sata`, `virtio_scsi`, or `virtio`.
*** The disk must not be configured as a direct LUN.
*** The disk status must not be `illegal` or `locked`.
*** The storage type must be `image`.
*** SCSI reservation must be disabled.
*** `ScsiGenericIO` must be disabled.

** Configuration:

*** If the VM uses GPU resources, the nodes providing the GPUs must be configured.
*** The VM must not be configured for vGPU resources.
*** The BIOS type must be `Q35 Chipset with Legacy BIOS`.
*** The custom emulated machine must be `Q35`.
+
[NOTE]
====
Virtual machines created with RHV 4.4 emulate the Intel Q35 chipset by default. However, you must update older virtual machines in the RHV 4.4 cluster.
====

*** The VM must not have snapshots with disks in an `illegal` state.
*** The VM must not have been created with {product-title} and subsequently added to RHV.
*** The VM must not be configured for USB devices.
*** The watchdog model must not be `diag288`.

ifdef::virt-importing-vmware-vm[]
Importing a VMware virtual machine into {VirtProductName} has the following prerequisites:

* You must have access to an image registry.
* You must create a VMware Virtual Disk Development Kit (VDDK) image, push it to an image registry, and add it to the `v2v-vmware` ConfigMap.
* The VMware virtual machine must be powered off.

* The {product-title} storage class must be NFS.

* There must be sufficient storage space for the imported disk.
+
[WARNING]
====
If you try to import a virtual machine whose disk size is larger than the available storage space, the operation cannot complete. You will not be able to import another virtual machine or to clean up the storage because there are insufficient resources to support object deletion. To resolve this situation, you must add more object storage devices to the storage backend.
