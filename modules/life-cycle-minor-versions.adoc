= Minor versions [.small]#x.Y.z#

Red Hat supports two minor versions of the major release.

* Y: The latest available minor release. For example, 4.8.
* Y-1: The previous minor version. For example, 4.7.

After an upgrade path from the previous minor version (Y-1) to the latest minor version (Y) is available, clusters running Y-2 must upgrade their cluster within a 30 day grace period. Any cluster remaining on Y-2 30 days after notification of upgrade availability will be classified as being in limited support status until the cluster is upgraded to a supported release.

.Example
. A customer's cluster is currently running on 4.5.18. The latest version for 4.6 is 4.6.27.
. On February 25, 4.7.2 is released as an available upgrade path from 4.6.27 and the customer is notified.
. The cluster must be upgraded to 4.6.27 or later by March 25.
. If the upgrade has not been performed, then the cluster will have SRE alerting disabled and will be unsupported until it is upgraded to 4.6.27 or later.
