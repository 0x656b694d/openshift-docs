= Configuring hostPath volumes in the Pod specification

You can use `hostPath` volumes to access `read-write` files on nodes. This can be useful for pods that can configure and monitor the host from the inside. You can also use `hostPath` volumes to mount volumes on the host using `mountPropagation`.

[WARNING]
====
Using `hostPath` volumes can be dangerous, as they allow pods to read and write any file on the host. Proceed with caution.
====

It is recommended that you specify `hostPath` volumes directly in the `Pod` specification, rather than in a `PersistentVolume` object. This is useful because the pod already knows the path it needs to access when configuring nodes.

.Procedure
. Create a privileged pod:
+
[source,yaml]
----
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: Pod
  metadata:
    name: pod-name
  spec:
    containers:
    ...
      securityContext:
        privileged: true
    volumeMounts:
    - mountPath: /host/etc/motd.confg <1>
      name: hostpath-privileged
  ...
  volumes:
    - name: hostpath-privileged
      hostPath:
          path: /etc/motd.confg <2>
----
<1> The path used to mount the `hostPath` share inside the privileged pod.
<2> The path on the host that is used to share into the privileged pod.

In this example, the pod can see the path of the host inside `/etc/motd.confg` as `/host/etc/motd.confg`. As a result, the `motd` can be configured without accessing the host directly.
