= Identifying the Dockerfile line in an image that adds a component with a CVE

[role="_abstract"]
You can identify the specific Dockerfile line in an image that adds a component that has been identified as having a CVE. 

.Procedure

To view the problematic line:

. Navigate to the {product-title-short} portal and click *Vulnerability Management* from the navigation menu.
. Select an image from either the *Top Riskiest Images* widget or click the *Images* button at the top of the Dashboard and select an image.
. In the *Image* details view, under *Image Findings*, CVEs are listed in the *Observed CVEs*, *Deferred CVEs*, and *False positive CVEs* tabs.
. Locate the CVE you want to examine further. In the *Affected Components* column, click on the *<number> Components* link to view a list of components affected by the CVE. You can perform the following actions in this window:
* Select the expand icon next to a specific component to view the Dockerfile line in the image where the component was added that contains the CVE. To address the CVE, you need to change this line in the Dockerfile; for example, you can upgrade the component. 
* Click the name of the component to go to the *Component Summary* page and view more information about the component.
