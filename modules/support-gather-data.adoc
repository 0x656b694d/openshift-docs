= Gathering data about your cluster for Red Hat Support

The `oc adm must-gather` CLI command collects the information from your cluster
that is most likely needed for debugging issues, such as:

* Resource definitions
* Audit logs
* Service logs

.Prerequisites

* Access to the cluster as a user with the `cluster-admin` role.

.Procedure

. Run the `oc adm must-gather` command:
+
----
$ oc adm must-gather
----
+
This creates a Pod on the cluster to perform the data collection on. All of the
collected resources and data from your cluster are saved in the current
directory in a new directory that starts with `must-gather.local`.

. Create a compressed file from the `must-gather` directory. For example, on a
computer that uses a Linux operating system, run the following command:
+
----
$ tar cvaf must-gather.tar.gz must-gather.local.5421342344627712289/
----

. Attach the compressed file to your support case on the
