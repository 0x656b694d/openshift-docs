[id="installation-bare-metal-config-yaml_{context}"]
= Sample `install-config.yaml` file for bare metal

You can customize the `install-config.yaml` file to specify more details about
your {product-title} cluster's platform or modify the values of the required
parameters.

----
<1> The base domain of the cluster. All DNS records must be sub-domains of this
base and include the cluster name.
<2> The `controlPlane` section is a singlet, and the `compute` section is an
array. Because the sections have different definitions, the first line of the
`compute` section must begin with a hyphen, `-`, and the first line of the
`controlPlane` section must not. Although both sections currently define a
single machine pool, it is possible that future versions of {product-title}
will support defining multiple compute pools during installation. Only one
control plane pool is used.
<3> Whether to enable or disable simultaneous multithreading, or
`hyperthreading`. By default, simultaneous multithreading is enabled
to increase the performance of your machines' cores. You can disable it by
setting the parameter value to `Disabled`. If you disable simultanous
multithreading in some cluster machines, you must disable it in all cluster
machines.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
If you disable simultaneous multithreading, ensure that your capacity planning
accounts for the dramatically decreased machine performance.
====
<4> You must set the number of workers to `0` in this file. Remember that you
must manually deploy at least one compute, or worker, machine in the cluster.
<5> The number of control plane machines that you add to the cluster. Because
the cluster uses this values as the number of etcd endpoints in the cluster, the
value must match the number of control plane machines that you deploy.
<6> The cluster name.
<7> A block of IP addresses from which pod IPs are allocated. This block must
not overlap with existing physical networks.
<8> The subnet prefix length to assign to each individual node. For example, if
`hostPrefix` is set to `23`, then each node is assigned a `/23` subnet out of
the given `cidr`, which allows for 510 (2^(32 - 23) - 2) pod IPs addresses.
<9> The IP address pool to use for service IP addresses. You can enter only
one IP address pool.
<10> The pull secret that allows you to authenticate with the services that are
provided by the included authorities, including Quay.io, which serves the
container images for {product-title} components.
<11> The default SSH key for the `core` user.
+
[NOTE]
====
For production {product-title} clusters on which you want to perform installation
debugging or disaster recovery, you must provide an SSH key that your `ssh-agent`
process uses to the installation program.
