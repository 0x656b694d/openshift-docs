== Bug fixes

This release also includes the following bug fixes:

* Due to an issue in the release pipeline scripts, the value of the `olm.skipRange` field remained unchanged at `5.2.0` and was not updated when the z-stream number, `0`, increased. The current release fixes the pipeline scripts to update the value of this field when the release numbers change.
