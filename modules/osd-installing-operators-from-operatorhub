== Installing Operators from the OperatorHub

{product-title} administrators can install Operators from a curated list provided by the OperatorHub. This makes the Operator available to all developers on your cluster to create Custom Resources and applications using that Operator.

====
[NOTE]
Privileged and custom Operators cannot be installed.
====

Administrators can only install Operators to the default `openshift-operators` namespace, except for the Cluster Logging Operator, which requires the `openshift-logging` namespace.
