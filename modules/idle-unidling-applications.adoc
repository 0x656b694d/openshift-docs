= Unidling applications

Application services become active again when they receive network traffic and
are scaled back up their previous state. This includes both traffic to the
services and traffic passing through routes.

Applications can also be manually unidled by scaling up the resources.

.Procedure

. To scale up a DeploymentConfig, run:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc scale --replicas=1 dc <dc_name>
----

[NOTE]
====
Automatic unidling by a router is currently only supported by the default
HAProxy router.
====
[NOTE]
====
Services do not support automatic unidling if you configure Kuryr-Kubernetes as an SDN.
====

[NOTE]
====
In {product-title} {product-version}, idled services do not become active again when they receive network traffic if they were idled while the leader `ovnkube-master` process was restarted or after the `ovnkube-master` leader changed. For more information, refer to link:https://access.redhat.com/solutions/6671241[Idled services cannot wake up automatically after restart of ovnkube-master in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4].
