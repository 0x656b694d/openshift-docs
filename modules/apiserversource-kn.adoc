= Using the ApiServerSource with the Knative CLI (`kn`)

This guide describes the steps required to create, manage, and delete an ApiServerSource using `kn` commands.

.Prerequisites

* You must have the `kn` CLI installed.

.Procedure

. Create an ApiServerSource event source by entering the following command:
+
----
$ kn source apiserver create testevents --sink broker:default --resource "event:v1" --service-account events-sa --mode Resource
----

. To check that the ApiServerSource is set up correctly, create a Knative service that dumps incoming messages to its log by entering the following command:
+
----
$ kn service create event-display --image quay.io/openshift-knative/knative-eventing-sources-event-display:v0.13.2
----

. Create a trigger from the `default` broker to filter events to the service created in the previous step by entering the following `kn` command:
+
----
$ kn trigger create event-display-trigger --sink svc:event-display
----

. Create events by launching a pod in the default namespace. You can do this by entering the following command:
+
----
$ oc create deployment hello-node --image=gcr.io/hello-minikube-zero-install/hello-node
----

. Check that the controller is mapped correctly by entering the following command and inspecting the output:
+
----
$ kn source apiserver describe testevents
----
+
The output should be similar to:
+
----
Name:                testevents
Namespace:           default
Annotations:         sources.knative.dev/creator=developer, sources.knative.dev/lastModifier=developer

  ++ SinkProvided              3m
  ++ SufficientPermissions     3m
  ++ EventTypesProvided        3m
----

.Verification steps

You can verify that the Kubernetes events were sent into the Knative eventing system by looking at the message dumper function logs.

You can view the message dumper function logs by entering the following commands:
----
$ oc get pods
$ oc logs $(oc get pod -o name | grep event-display) -c user-container
----

The logs should contain lines similar to the following:
----
☁️  cloudevents.Event

Context Attributes,
  specversion: 1.0
  type: dev.knative.apiserver.resource.update
  datacontenttype: application/json
  ...

    "involvedObject": {
      "apiVersion": "v1",
      "fieldPath": "spec.containers{hello-node}",
      "kind": "Pod",
      "name": "hello-node",
      "namespace": "default",
       .....
    },
    "kind": "Event",
    "message": "Started container",
    "metadata": {
      "name": "hello-node.159d7608e3a3572c",
      "namespace": "default",
      ....
    },
    "reason": "Started",
    ...
  }

== Deleting the ApiServerSource

You can delete the ApiServerSource, trigger, service, service account, cluster role, and cluster binding created in this guide by entering the following `kn` and `oc` commands:
----
$ kn trigger delete event-display-trigger
$ kn service delete event-display
$ kn source apiserver delete testevents
$ oc delete -f authentication.yaml
----
