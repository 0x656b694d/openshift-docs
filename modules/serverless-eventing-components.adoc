= Knative Eventing components

A typical Knative Eventing deployment on {ServerlessProductName} follows this basic workflow.

. Event producers send information about changes in the state of the system to an event source.
. The event source translates this information into an event, which is then passed to the broker.
. After an event has been sent to the broker, triggers can filter which events are routed to a subscription.

Using the broker and trigger Kubernetes Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) together enables an event delivery mechanism that hides the details of event routing from the event producer and event consumer.
Events can also be passed directly from an event channel to a broker or to a subscription directly.

Event source:: Event sources are Kubernetes custom resources that provide a mechanism for registering interest in a class of events from an event producer.
+
{ServerlessProductName} can be used with Kafka and Camel K event sources, which are installed using the Operator Hub in the {product-title} web console.

Broker:: A broker represents an event mesh. Events are sent to the broker's ingress and are then sent to any event consumers that are subscribed to that broker.
After the event is in the broker, metadata for the event is stripped away so that there is no information about how the event entered the broker.
+
.Example broker YAML definition
----
apiVersion: eventing.knative.dev/v1alpha1
kind: Broker
metadata:
  name: default <1>
spec:
  channelTemplateSpec: <2>
    apiVersion: messaging.knative.dev/v1alpha1
    kind: InMemoryChannel
----

<1> The `default` broker is provided with your {ServerlessProductName} Knative Eventing installation.
<2> Event channels can be specified in the `channelTemplateSpec`.

// NOTE: this is being replaced. Update when details are available upstream.


Trigger:: A trigger enables a Knative service to subscribe to events from a specific broker.
+
.Example trigger YAML definition
----
apiVersion: eventing.knative.dev/v1alpha1
kind: Trigger
metadata:
  name: my-service-trigger <1>
spec:
  broker: default <2>
  subscriber: <3>
    ref:
      apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1
      kind: Service
      name: my-service
----

<1> The name of the trigger.
<2> Specifies the name of the broker that the trigger will listen for events from.
<3> The `subscriber` section defines the Knative service that the broker sends events to.
