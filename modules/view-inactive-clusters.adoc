.Procedure
. On the {product-title-short} portal, navigate to *Platform Configuration* -> *System Configuration*.

[NOTE]
====
If this feature is enabled after a cluster is considered inactive, the counting of days towards deletion starts from the time the cluster became inactive, not from the time that the feature was enabled. If there are any inactive clusters that you do not want deleted, you can configure a label as described in the "Configuring cluster decommissioning" section. Labeled clusters are ignored when the system deletes inactive clusters.
