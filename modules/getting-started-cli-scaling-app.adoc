= Scaling the application

In Kubernetes, a `Deployment`(D) defines how an application deploys. In most cases, users use `Pod`, `Service`, `ReplicaSets`(RS), and `Deployment` resources together. In most cases, {product-title} creates the resources for you.

When you deploy the `national-parks-app` image, a deployment resource is created.  In this example, only one `Pod` is deployed.

The following procedure scales the `national-parks-image` to use two instances.

.Prerequisites

* You are logged in to the {product-title} web console.
* You are in the xref:../web_console/odc-about-developer-perspective.adoc#odc-about-developer-perspective[*Developer* perspective].
* You have a deployed image.

.Procedure

* To scale your application from one pod instance to two pod instances, enter the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc scale --current-replicas=1 --replicas=2 deployment/parksmap
----
+
.Example output
[source,text]
----
deployment.apps/parksmap scaled
----

.Verification
* To ensure that your application scaled properly, enter the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get pods
----
+
.Example output
[source,terminal]
----

.Scale down your application

* To scale your application back down to one pod instance, enter the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc scale --current-replicas=2 --replicas=1 deployment/parksmap
----
