If you have already installed the required prerequisites, here are the commands you need to create a cluster.

[source, terminal]

## Configures your AWS account and ensures everything is setup correctly
$ rosa init

## Starts the cluster creation process (~30-40minutes) and watches the logs
$ rosa create cluster --cluster-name <my_cluster_name> --watch

## Connect your IDP to your cluster
$ rosa create idp --cluster <my_cluster_name> --interactive

## Promotes a user from your IDP to admin level
$ rosa create user --cluster <my_cluster_name> --dedicated-admins <admin_username>

## and provides your Console URL to login to the web console.
$ rosa describe cluster <my_cluster_name>
