= Pipelines

A _Pipeline_ is a collection of Tasks arranged in a specific order of execution. You can define a CI/CD workflow for your application using Pipelines containing one or more Tasks.

A Pipeline definition consists of a number of fields or attributes, which together enable the Pipeline to accomplish a specific goal. Each Pipeline definition must contain at least one Task, which ingests specific inputs and produces specific outputs. The Pipeline definition can also optionally include Conditions, Workspaces, Parameters, or Resources depending on the application requirements.

Here is a code snippet of a Pipeline `build-and-deploy`, which builds an application image from a Git repository using `buildah` ClusterTask:

----
<1> Pipeline API version `v1beta1`.
<2> Specifies the type of Kubernetes object. In this example, `Pipeline`.
<3> Unique name of this Pipeline.
<4> Specifies the definition and structure of the Pipeline.
<5> Set of resources required to run the Tasks specified in the Pipeline.
<6> Parameters used across all the Tasks in the Pipeline.
<7> Specifies the list of Tasks used in the Pipeline. In this example, two Tasks are specified: `build-image` and `apply-manifests`.
<8> Task `build-image`, which uses the `buildah` ClusterTask to build application images from a given Git repository.
<9> Task `apply-manifests`, which uses a user-defined Task with the same name.
<10> Specifies the sequence in which Tasks are run in a Pipeline. In this example, the `apply-manifests` Task is run only after the `build-image` Task is completed.
