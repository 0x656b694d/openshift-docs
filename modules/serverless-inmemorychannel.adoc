= Using the default InMemoryChannel configuration

InMemoryChannels are for development use only, and should not be used in a production environment.

The following are limitations of InMemoryChannel type channels:

* No event persistence is available. If a Pod goes down, events on that Pod are lost.
* InMemoryChannel type channels do not implement event ordering, so two events that are received in the channel at the same time can be delivered to a subscriber in any order.
* If a subscriber rejects an event, there are no re-delivery attempts. Instead, the rejected event is sent to a `deadLetterSink` if this sink exists, or is otherwise dropped. For more information about configuring event delivery and `deadLetterSink` settings for a channel, see xref:../../serverless/knative_eventing/serverless-subscriptions.adoc#serverless-subscriptions[Using subscriptions to send events from a channel to a sink].

When you install Knative Eventing, the following custom resource definition (CRD) is created automatically:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  namespace: knative-eventing
  name: config-br-default-channel
data:
  channelTemplateSpec: |
    apiVersion: messaging.knative.dev/v1
    kind: InMemoryChannel

.Creating a channel using the cluster default configuration

* Create a generic Channel custom object.
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: messaging.knative.dev/v1
kind: Channel
metadata:
  name: example-channel
  namespace: default
----
+
When the Channel object is created, a mutating admission webhook adds a set of `spec.channelTemplate` properties for the Channel object based on the default channel implementation.
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: messaging.knative.dev/v1
kind: Channel
metadata:
  name: example-channel
  namespace: default
spec:
  channelTemplate:
    apiVersion: messaging.knative.dev/v1
    kind: InMemoryChannel
----

The channel controller then creates the backing channel instance based on that `spec.channelTemplate` configuration. The `spec.channelTemplate` properties cannot be changed after creation, because they are set by the default channel mechanism rather than by the user.

When this mechanism is used, two objects are created: a generic channel, and an InMemoryChannel type channel.

The generic channel acts as a proxy that copies its subscriptions to the InMemoryChannel, and sets its status to reflect the status of the backing InMemoryChannel type channel.

Because the channel in this example is created in the default namespace, the channel uses the cluster default, which is InMemoryChannel.
