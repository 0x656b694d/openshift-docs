= Upgrade pathways for minor releases

The upgrade pathway is different depending on the 2.4.z version of {VirtProductName} that you have installed.

[id="virt-upgrade-pathways-2.4.3_{context}"]
== Upgrading from 2.4.3 to 2.5.1

You must first upgrade to 2.5.0 before you can upgrade the z-stream. You can then upgrade from 2.5.0 to 2.5.1.

If your *Approval Strategy* is *Automatic*, which is the default, {VirtProductName} upgrades the z-stream automatically once you have upgraded to 2.5.0.

[id="virt-upgrade-pathways-2.4.4_{context}"]
== Upgrading from 2.4.4 to 2.5.1

You cannot currently upgrade from 2.4.4 to 2.5.0 or 2.5.1.

// This needs to be updated when 2.5.2 is released
