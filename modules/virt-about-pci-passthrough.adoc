= About preparing nodes and the cluster for PCI passthrough

The Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) passthrough feature enables you to access and manage hardware devices from a virtual machine. When PCI passthrough is configured, the PCI devices function as if they were physically attached to the virtual machine.

To configure a hardware device as a host device for PCI passthrough, create a `MachineConfig` object file and add kernel arguments to enable Input-Output Memory Management Unit (IOMMU). Bind the PCI device to the Virtual Function I/O (VFIO) driver by creating a `MachineConfig` object file. Then, add the PCI device to the HyperConverged Operator.
