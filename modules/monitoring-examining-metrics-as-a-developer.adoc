= Examining metrics as a developer

You might enable user workload monitoring for an application or service in a project. In that case, a developer of that project can examine the exposed custom metrics using the Developer Perspective in the Web console.

:FeatureName: Examining metrics using the Developer Perspective
include::modules/technology-preview.adoc[leveloffset=+0]

.Procedure

. Open the {product-title} Web console, switch to the Developer Perspective, and navigate to the *Advanced* -> *Metrics* page. Select the project where the user workload resides.
