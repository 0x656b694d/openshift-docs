= Completing an AWS installation on user-provisioned infrastructure

After you start the {product-title} installation on Amazon Web Service (AWS)
user-provisioned infrastructure, remove the bootstrap node, and wait for
installation to complete.

.Prerequisites

* Deploy the bootstrap node for an {product-title} cluster on user-provisioned AWS infrastructure.
* Install the `oc` CLI and log in.

.Procedure

. Delete the bootstrap resources. If you used the CloudFormation template,
link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cfn-console-delete-stack.html[delete its stack]:
+
----
$ aws cloudformation delete-stack --stack-name <name> <1>
----
<1> `<name>` is the name of your bootstrap stack.

. Complete the cluster installation:
+
----
$ ./openshift-install --dir=<installation_directory> wait-for install-complete <1>

INFO Waiting up to 30m0s for the cluster to initialize...
----
<1> For `<installation_directory>`, specify the path to the directory that you
stored the installation files in.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
The Ignition config files that the installation program generates contain certificates that expire after 24 hours. You must keep the cluster running for 24 hours in a non-degraded state to ensure that the first certificate rotation has finished.
