= Removing a cluster on {rh-openstack} that uses your own infrastructure

You can remove an {product-title} cluster on {rh-openstack-first} that uses your own infrastructure. To complete the removal process quickly, create and run several Ansible playbooks.

.Prerequisites

* Python 3 is installed on your machine
* You downloaded the modules in "Downloading playbook dependencies"

.Procedure

[NOTE]
You may have the `common.yaml` and `inventory.yaml` playbooks left over from when you installed {product-title}. If you do, you can skip the first two steps of the procedure.

. Insert the following content into a local file called `common.yaml`:
+
[source,yaml]
----
include::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift/installer/release-4.5/upi/openstack/common.yaml[]
----

. Insert the following content into a local file called `inventory.yaml`, and edit the values to match your own:
+
[source,yaml]
----
include::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift/installer/release-4.5/upi/openstack/inventory.yaml[]
----

. _Optional_: If your cluster uses Kuryr, insert the following content into a local file called `down-06_load-balancers.yaml`:
+
[source,yaml]
----
include::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift/installer/release-4.5/upi/openstack/down-load-balancers.yaml[]
----

. Insert the following content into a local file called `down-05_compute-nodes.yaml`:
+
[source,yaml]
----
include::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift/installer/release-4.5/upi/openstack/down-compute-nodes.yaml[]
----

. Insert the following content into a local file called `down-04_control-plane.yaml`:
+
[source,yaml]
----
include::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift/installer/release-4.5/upi/openstack/down-control-plane.yaml[]
----

. Insert the following content into a local file called `down-03_bootstrap.yaml`:
+
[source,yaml]
----
include::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift/installer/release-4.5/upi/openstack/down-bootstrap.yaml[]
----

. Insert the following content into a local file called `down-02_network.yaml`:
+
[source,yaml]
----
include::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift/installer/release-4.5/upi/openstack/down-network.yaml[]
----

. Insert the following content into a local file called `down-01_security-groups.yaml`:
+
[source,yaml]
----
include::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift/installer/release-4.5/upi/openstack/down-security-groups.yaml[]
----

. On a command line, run the playbooks you created:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ansible-playbook -i inventory.yaml  \
	down-03_bootstrap.yaml      \
	down-04_control-plane.yaml  \
	down-05_compute-nodes.yaml  \
	down-06_load-balancers.yaml \
	down-02_network.yaml        \
	down-01_security-groups.yaml
----

. Remove any DNS record changes you made for the {product-title} installation.

{product-title} is removed from your infrastructure.
