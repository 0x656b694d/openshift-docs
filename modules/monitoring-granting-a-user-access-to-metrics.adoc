= Granting a user access to metrics

By default, only cluster administrator users have access to user workload metrics. Using the soft tenancy feature, you can also grant metrics access to an arbitrary user, who only has access to a particular project.

.Prerequisites

* You need deploy the workload that you want to monitor, such as an application or a service. This example uses the application described in xref:../monitoring/user-workload-monitoring.adoc#deploying-a-sample-application[Deploying a sample application].
* You need to have user workload monitoring enabled.
* You need to have a user created.

.Procedure

. In the Web console, navigate to *User Management* -> *Role Bindings* -> *Create Binding*.
. In *Binding Type*, select the "Namespace Role Binding" type.
. In *Name*, enter a name for the binging.
. In *Namespace*, select the namespace where you want to grant the access.
. In *Role Name*, enter `cluster-monitoring-view`.
. In *Subject*, select *User*.
. In *Subject Name*, enter name of the user, for example `johnsmith`.
. Confirm the role binding. Now the user has been assigned the `cluster-monitoring-view` role, which allows him to access the metrics.
