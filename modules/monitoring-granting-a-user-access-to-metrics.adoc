= Granting a user access to metrics

By default, only cluster administrator users have access to metrics from your services. Using the soft tenancy feature, you can also grant metrics access to an arbitrary user, who only has access to a particular project. (FIXME remove duplication) This procedure shows how to assign the (FIXME name) role to the user to give them access to metrics.

.Prerequisites

* You need deploy the service that you want to monitor. This example uses the application described in "Deploying a sample application".
* You need to enable monitoring your own services.
* You need to have a user created.
* You need to have the role described in "Creating a role for accessing the metrics" created. FIXME check the section is written

.Procedure

. In the Web console, navigate to *User Management* -> *Role Bindings* -> *Create Binding*.
. In *Binding Type*, select the "Namespace Role Binding" type.
. In *Name*, enter a name for the binging.
. In *Namespace*, select the namespace where you want to grant the access.
. In *Role Name*, enter `FIXME role name`.
. In *Subject*, select *User*.
. In *Subject Name*, enter name of the user, for example `johnsmith`.
. Confirm the role binding. Now the user has been assigned the `FIXME role name` role, which allows him to access the metrics.
