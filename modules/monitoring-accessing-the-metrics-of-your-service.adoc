= Accessing the metrics of your service

Once you have enabled monitoring your own services, deployed the service, and, optionally, gave additional view permissions, you can access the metrics of the service as a cluster administrator, as a developer, or as another user with permissions.

.Prerequisites

* You need to deploy the service that you want to monitor. This example uses the service described in "Deploying a sample service".
* You need to enable monitoring your own services.
* If accessing metrics as an arbitrary user, the user needs to have the permissions as described in "Granting a user access to metrics".

.Procedure

. Access the Prometheus web interface:
+
* To access the metrics as a cluster administrator, go to the {product-title} web console, switch to the Administrator Perspective, and click *Monitoring* -> *Metrics*.
+
[NOTE]
====
Cluster administrators, when using the Administrator Perspective, have access to all cluster metrics and to custom service metrics from all projects.
====
* To access the metrics as a developer or a user with permissions, go to the {product-title} web console, switch to the Developer Perspective, then click *Advanced* -> *Metrics*. Select the project you want to see the metrics for.
+
[NOTE]
====
Developers can only use the Developer Perspective. They can only query metrics from a single project.
====
. Use the PromQL interface to run queries for your services.

.Additional resources

* See the xref:../monitoring/cluster-monitoring/examining-cluster-metrics.adoc#examining-cluster-metrics[section on using the PromQL interface].
