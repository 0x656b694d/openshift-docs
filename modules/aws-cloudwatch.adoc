= AWS CloudWatch

The AWS CloudWatch service is available as an add-on to your {product-title} cluster. AWS CloudWatch is a log forwarding solution that lets you view {product-title} logs in the AWS console.

You must first install the `cluster-logging-operator` using the `rosa` CLI before installing the AWS CloudWatch service. The AWS CloudWatch add-on can be installed using either the `rosa` CLI or the OpenShift Cluster Manager (OCM). For more information, see link:https://docs.openshift.com/rosa/logging/rosa-install-logging.html#rosa-install-logging[Installing logging add-on services].
