.Procedure
. On the RHACS portal, navigate to *Platform Configuration* -> *Policies*.

. In the *Attach Notifiers* section, select the check box for the {toolname} notifier.

====
. Click *Next* until you reach *Review Policy*, then click *Save*.

[NOTE]
====
* {product-title} sends notifications on an opt-in basis.
To receive notifications, you must first assign a notifier to the policy.
* Notifications are only sent once for a given alert.
If you have assigned a notifier to a policy, you will not receive a notification unless a violation generates a new alert.

* {product-title} creates a new alert for the following scenarios:
** A policy violation occurs for the first time in a deployment.
** A runtime-phase policy violation occurs in a deployment after you resolved the previous runtime alert for a policy in that deployment.
