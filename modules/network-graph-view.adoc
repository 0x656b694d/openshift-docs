= Network graph view

[role="_abstract"]
The network graph provides visibility and control over:

* The allowed network connections, as defined by the Kubernetes network policies.
* The active communications paths among namespaces and deployments.

In the menu bar, choose the cluster for which you want to view information and at least one namespace.

In the *Network Graph* view, you can configure the type of connections you want to see.
In the *Flows* section (upper left), select:

* *Active* to view only active connections.
* *Allowed* to view only allowed network connections.
* *All* to view both active and allowed network connections.

In the *Network Graph*, click *Legend* to view information about the symbols in use and their meaning. The legend shows explanatory text for symbols representing namespaces, deployments, and connections on the network graph.

Clicking on an item in the *Network Graph*, such as a deployment or a namespace, opens a window that displays additional information. You can expand and collapse the window by selecting the arrow in the blue bar.

When you hover over:

* a connection, you see information about the network flow, which includes active connections, port numbers, and protocols in use.
* a deployment, you see information about ingress and egress connections, protocols, port numbers in use, and the direction of the network traffic between deployments.

== Allowed network connections

{product-title} processes all network policies in each secured cluster to show you which deployments can contact each other and which can reach external networks.

The network graph shows possible network connections as dashed lines.

[discrete]
== Actual network flows

{product-title} monitors running deployments and tracks traffic between them.
The network graph shows observed network flows as solid lines.

[discrete]
== Network baseline

{product-title} discovers existing network flows and creates a baseline.
//See link:/docs/manage-network-policies/use-network-baselining/[Use network baselining] for more details.

To view the network baseline for a deployment, select that deployment in the *Network Graph* view.
The *Network Flows* details panel show both anomalous and baseline flows.
From this panel, you can:

* Mark network flows from the baseline as anomalous by selecting *Mark as Anomalous*.
* Add network flows to the baseline from the anomalous flows by selecting *Add to Baseline*.

[discrete]
== External entities and connections

The *Network Graph* view shows network connections between managed clusters and external sources.
In addition, {product-title} automatically discovers and highlights public Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) address blocks, such as Google Cloud, AWS, Azure, Oracle Cloud, and Cloudflare.
Using this information, you can identify deployments with active external connections and determine if they are making or receiving unauthorized connections from outside your network.

By default, the external connections point to a common *External Entities* box and different CIDR address blocks in the *Network Graph* view.
However, you can choose not to show auto-discovered CIDR blocks.

{product-title} includes IP ranges for the following cloud providers:

* Google Cloud
* AWS
* Azure
* Oracle Cloud
* Cloudflare

{product-title} fetches and updates the cloud providers' IP ranges every 7 days.
If you are using offline mode,  you can update these ranges by installing new support packages.
