= Scaling a machine set manually

If you must add or remove an instance of a machine in a machine set, you can manually scale the machine set.

.Prerequisites

* Install an {product-title} cluster and the `oc` command line.
* Log in to  `oc` as a user with `cluster-admin` permission.

.Procedure

. View the machine sets that are in the cluster:
+
----
$ oc get machinesets -n openshift-machine-api
----
+
The machine sets are listed in the form of `<clusterid>-worker-<aws-region-az>`.

. Scale the machine set:
+
----
$ oc scale --replicas=2 machineset <machineset> -n openshift-machine-api
----
Or:
+
----
$ oc edit machineset <machineset> -n openshift-machine-api
----
+
You can scale the machine set up or down. It takes several minutes for the new machines to be available.
