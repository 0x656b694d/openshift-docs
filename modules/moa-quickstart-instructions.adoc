If you have already installed the required prerequisites, here are the commands you need to create a cluster.

[source, terminal]
----
## Configures your AWS account and ensures everything is setup correctly
$ moactl init

## Starts the cluster creation process (~30-40minutes) and watches the logs
$ moactl create cluster --cluster-name <my_cluster_name> --watch

## Connect your IDP to your cluster
$ moactl create idp --cluster <my_cluster_name> --interactive

## Promotes a user from your IDP to admin level
$ moactl create user --cluster <my_cluster_name> --dedicated-admins <admin_username>        

## Checks if your install is ready (look for State: Ready),
## and provides your Console URL to login to the web console.
$ moactl describe cluster <my_cluster_name>
