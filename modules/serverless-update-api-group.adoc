= Updating the API group

In {ServerlessProductName} 1.4.0 and newer versions, the `KnativeServing` object's API group changed from `serving.knative.dev` to `operator.knative.dev`.
You must adjust any of your scripts or applications that rely on the old API group to use the new API group.

.Procedure

. Update your scripts or applications that rely on the old API group to use the new API group.

. After you update references to the new API group, you must remove any older custom resource (CR) versions and use the newly deployed `KnativeServing` CR instead.
+
To safely do this without downtime, remove the owner reference from the newly deployed `KnativeServing` CR by entering the following command:
+
----
 $ oc edit knativeserving.operator.knative.dev knative-serving -n knative-serving
----

. After the owner reference has been removed, you can safely remove any older CR versions and start using the new one.

. This change to the API group causes commands without a fully qualified API group and kind, such as `oc get knativeserving`, to become unreliable and not always work correctly.
+
After upgrading to {ServerlessProductName} 1.6.0, you must remove the old custom resource definition (CRD) to fix this issue.
+
You can remove the old CRD by entering the following command:
+
----
$ oc delete crd knativeservings.serving.knative.dev
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
If a previous version of the CR exists, changes to the new CR will be overwritten by the {ServerlessOperatorName}. While the old CR is still active, all changes need to be made to that CR.
