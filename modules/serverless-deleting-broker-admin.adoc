= Deleting a broker that was created by a cluster administrator using namespace annotation

Brokers created due to annotation will not be removed if you remove the annotation. You must manually delete them.

.Procedure

. Remove the `knative-eventing-injection=enabled` annotation from the namespace:
+

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc label namespace <NAMESPACE> knative-eventing-injection-
----

+
Removing the annotation prevents you from recreating the broker after you delete it.

. Delete the injected broker from the selected namespace:
+

[source,terminal]
----
$ oc -n <NAMESPACE> delete broker <BROKER-NAME>
----
