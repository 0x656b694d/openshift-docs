= Enabling your Operator for restricted network environments

As an Operator author, your CSV must meet the following additional requirements
for your Operator to run properly in a restricted network environment:

* List any _related images_, or other container images that your Operator might
require to perform their functions.
* Reference all specified images by a digest (SHA) and not by a tag.

When processed by the Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM), the related image
references are then passed down and populated as annotations on the Operator's
Deployment objects:

[source,yaml]
----
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: etcd-operator
  annotations:
    default: quay.io/coreos/etcd@sha256:12345
    olm.relatedImage.etcd-2.1.5: quay.io/coreos/etcd@sha256:12345
    olm.relatedImage.etcd-3.1.1: quay.io/coreos/etcd@sha256:12345

.Prerequisites

* An Operator project with a CSV

.Procedure

* In your Operator's CSV, define a list of any related images:
+
[source,yaml]
----
kind: ClusterServiceVersion
metadata:
  name: etcd-operator
spec:
[...]
  relatedImages: <1>
  - name: default
    image: quay.io/coreos/etcd@sha256:12345 <2>
  - name: etcd-2.1.5
    image: quay.io/coreos/etcd@sha256:12345 <2>
  - name: etcd-3.1.1
    image: quay.io/coreos/etcd@sha256:12345 <2>
----
<1> Create a `relatedImages` section and set the list of related images.
<2> Specify each image by a digest (SHA), not by an image tag.
