= Accessing user workload metrics

Once you have enabled user workload monitoring, deployed the workload, and, optionally, gave additional view permissions, you can access the custom metrics as the cluster administrator, as a developer, or as another user with permissions.

.Prerequisites

* You need to deploy the workload that you want to monitor, such as an application or a service. This example uses the application described in "Deploying a sample application".
* You need to have user workload monitoring enabled.
* If accessing metrics as an arbitrary user, the user needs to have the permissions as described in "Granting a user access to metrics".

.Procedure

. Access the Prometheus web interface:
+
* To access the metrics as a cluster administrator, go to the {product-title} web console, switch to the Administrator Perspective, and click *Monitoring* -> *Metrics*.
+
[NOTE]
====
Cluster administrators, when using the Administrator Perspective, have access to all cluster metrics and to user workload metrics from all namespaces.
====
* To access the metrics as a developer or a user with permissions, go to the {product-title} web console, switch to the Developer Perspective, then click *Advanced* -> *Metrics*. Select the project where the user workload resides.
+
[NOTE]
====
Developers can only use the Developer Perspective. They can only query metrics from a single namespace.
====
. Use the PromQL interface to run queries for user workload metrics. This works the same as with cluster metrics queries. The autocompletion works for the user workload metrics, too.

.Additional resources

* See the xref:../monitoring/cluster-monitoring/examining-cluster-metrics.adoc#examining-cluster-metrics[section on using the PromQL interface].
