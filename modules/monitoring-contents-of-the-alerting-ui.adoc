= Contents of the Alerting UI

This section shows and explains the contents of the Alerting UI, a web interface to the Alertmanager.

The Alerting UI is accessible by clicking *Monitoring* -> *Alerting* in the {product-title} web console.

The three main pages of the Alerting UI are the *Alerts*, the *Silences*, and the *Alerting rules* pages.

The *Alerts* page:

. Filtering alerts by their names.

. Alert name.
. Description of an alert.
. Value of the Severity label of the alert.
. Current state of the alert and when the alert went into this state.
. Actions you can do with the alert.

The *Silences* page:

. Creating a silence for an alert.
. Filtering silences by their name.

. Description of a silence. It includes the silence name and the specification of alerts that it matches.
. Number of alerts that are being silenced by the silence.
. Current state of the silence. For active silences, it shows when the silence ends. For pending silences, it shows when the silence starts.
. User that created the silence.
