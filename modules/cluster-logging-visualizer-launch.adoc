= Launching the log visualizer

{product-title} uses Kibana as the log visualizer. Kibana is a browser-based console to query, discover, and visualize your logs through histograms, line graphs,
pie charts, heat maps, built-in geospatial support, and other visualizations.

.Procedure

To launch Kibana:

. In the {product-title} console, click the Application Launcher {launch} and select *Logging*.

. Log in using the same credentials you use to log in to the {product-title} console.
+
The Kibana interface launches.

[NOTE]
====
If you get a *security_exception* error in the Kibana console and cannot access your Kibana indices, you might have an expired OAuth token. If you see this error, log out of the Kibana console, and then log back in. This refreshes your OAuth tokens and you should be able to access your indices.
