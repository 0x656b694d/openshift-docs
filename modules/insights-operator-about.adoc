= About the Insights Operator

// The Insights Operator collects anonymized information about:
//
// * The version of the {product-title} cluster and its components
// * The health, status, and current errors that are reported by {product-title} components and nodes
// * The network topology
// * Additional product features in use, such as Service Mesh or Serverless
//
// This information is reported to Red Hat Insights and is used by Red Hat to provide better support for the {product-title} cluster. None of the information is shared with third parties.


The Insights Operator periodically gathers anonymized configuration and component failure status and reports that to Red Hat. This is a subset of the information captured by the `must-gather` tool and allows Red Hat to assess important configuration and deeper failure data than is reported via Telemetry. This data is sent several times a day and describes:

* Important configuration information about the environment that the cluster runs in
* Details about the state of the cluster and its major components
* Debugging information about infrastructure Pods or nodes that are reporting failures

This debugging information is available to Red Hat Support and engineering teams with the same restrictions as accessing data reported via support cases. All connected cluster information is used by Red Hat to help make {product-title} better and more intuitive to use. None of the information is shared with third parties.
