[id="new-features-1-7_{context}"]
== New features

In addition to the fixes and stability improvements, the following sections highlight what is new in {pipelines-title} 1.7.

[id="pipelines-new-features-1-7_{context}"]
=== Pipelines

* With this update, the `when` expressions in a `Task` object are scoped to guard the tasks by default. To continue guarding the `Task` object and its dependent tasks, set the `scope-when-expressions-to-task` flag to `true`. 
+
[NOTE]
====
The `scope-when-expressions-to-task` flag is deprecated and will be removed in a future release. As a best practice for {pipelines-shortname}, use `when` expressions scoped to the guarded `Task` only.
====
// https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/pull/4580

* With this update, you can use variable substitution in the `subPath` field of a workspace within a task.
// https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/pull/4351

* With this update, you can reference parameters and results by using a bracket notation with single or double quotes. Prior to this update, you could only use the dot notation. For example, the following are now equivalent:
** `$(param.myparam)`, `$(param['myparam'])`, and `$(param["myparam"])`. 
+
You can use single or double quotes to enclose parameter names that contain problematic characters, such as `"."`. For example, `$(param['my.param'])` and `$(param["my.param"])`.
// https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/pull/4268

* With this update, you can include the the `onError` parameter of a step in the task definition without enabling the `enable-api-fields` flag.
// https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/pull/4251

[id="triggers-new-features-1-7_{context}"]
=== Triggers

* With this update, the `feature-flag-triggers` config map has a new field `labels-exclusion-pattern`. You can set the value of this field to a regular expression (regex) pattern. The controller filters out labels that match the regex pattern from propagating from the event listener to the resources created for the event listener.
// https://github.com/tektoncd/triggers/pull/1227

* With this update, the `TriggerGroups` field is added to the `EventListener` specification. Using this field, you can specify a set of interceptors to run before selecting and running a group of triggers. To enable this feature, set the `enable-api-fields` flag in the `feature-flags-triggers` config map to `alpha`.
// https://github.com/tektoncd/triggers/pull/1232

* With this update, `Trigger` resources support custom runs defined by a `TriggerTemplate` template.
// https://github.com/tektoncd/triggers/pull/1283/files

* With this update, Triggers support emitting Kubernetes events from an `EventListener` pod.
// https://github.com/tektoncd/triggers/pull/1222

* With this update, count metrics are available for the following objects: `ClusterInteceptor`, `EventListener`, `TriggerTemplate`, `ClusterTriggerBinding`, and `TriggerBinding`.
// https://github.com/tektoncd/triggers/pull/1305

* This update adds the `ServicePort` specification to Kubernetes resource. You can use this specification to modify which port exposes the event listener service. The default port is `8080`.
// https://github.com/tektoncd/triggers/pull/1272

* With this update, you can use the `targetURI` field in the `EventListener` specification to send cloud events during trigger processing. To enable this feature, set the `enable-api-fields` flag in the `feature-flags-triggers` config map to `alpha`.
// https://github.com/tektoncd/triggers/pull/1259

* With this update, the `tekton-triggers-eventlistener-roles` object now has a `patch` verb, in addition to the `create` verb that already exists.
// https://github.com/tektoncd/triggers/pull/1291

* With this update, the `securityContext.runAsUser` parameter is removed from event listener deployment.
// https://github.com/tektoncd/triggers/pull/1213

[id="cli-new-features-1-7_{context}"]
=== CLI

* With this update, the `tkn [pipeline | pipelinerun] export` command exports a pipeline or pipeline run as a YAML file. For example:
** Export a pipeline named `test_pipeline` in the `openshift-pipelines` namespace:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ tkn pipeline export test_pipeline -n openshift-pipelines
----
** Export a pipeline run named `test_pipeline_run` in the `openshift-pipelines` namespace:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ tkn pipelinerun export test_pipeline_run -n openshift-pipelines
----
// https://github.com/tektoncd/cli/pull/1398 and https://github.com/tektoncd/cli/pull/1500

* With this update, the `--grace` option is added to the `tkn pipelinerun cancel`. Use the `--grace` option to terminate a pipeline run gracefully instead of forcing the termination. To enable this feature, set the `enable-api-fields` flag in the `feature-flags` config map to `alpha`.
// https://github.com/tektoncd/cli/pull/1479

* This update adds the Operator and Chains versions to the output of the `tkn version` command.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Tekton Chains is a Technology Preview feature.
====
// https://github.com/tektoncd/cli/pull/1486 and https://github.com/tektoncd/cli/pull/1509

* With this update, the `tkn pipelinerun describe` command displays all canceled task runs, when you cancel a pipeline run. Before this fix, only one task run was displayed.
// https://github.com/tektoncd/cli/pull/1482

* With this update, you can skip supplying the asking specifications for optional workspace when you run the `tkn [t | p | ct] start` command skips with the `--skip-optional-workspace` flag. You can also skip it when running in interactive mode.
// https://github.com/tektoncd/cli/pull/1465

* With this update, you can use the `tkn chains` command to manage Tekton Chains. You can also use the `--chains-namespace` option to specify the namespace where you want to install Tekton Chains.

[id="hub-new-features-1-7_{context}"]
=== Hub

[IMPORTANT]
====
Deploying Tekton Hub on a cluster is a Technology Preview feature.
====

Tekton Hub helps you discover, search, and share reusable tasks and pipelines for your CI/CD workflows. A public instance of Tekton Hub is available at link:https://hub.tekton.dev/[hub.tekton.dev]. 

Staring with {pipelines-title} 1.7, cluster administrators can also install and deploy a custom instance of Tekton Hub on enterprise clusters. You can curate a catalog with reusable tasks and pipelines specific to your organization.

[id="chains-new-features-1-7_{context}"]
=== Chains

[IMPORTANT]
====
Tekton Chains is a Technology Preview feature.
====

Tekton Chains is a Kubernetes Custom Resource Definition (CRD) controller. You can use it to manage the supply chain security of the tasks and pipelines created using {pipelines-title}.

By default, Tekton Chains monitors the task runs in your {product-title} cluster. Chains takes snapshots of completed task runs, converts them to one or more standard payload formats, and signs and stores all artifacts.

Tekton Chains supports the following features:

* You can sign task runs, task run results, and OCI registry images with cryptographic key types and services such as `cosign`.

* You can use attestation formats such as `in-toto`.

* You can securely store signatures and signed artifacts using OCI repository as a storage backend.

[id="pac-new-features-1-7_{context}"]
=== Pipelines as Code (PAC)

[IMPORTANT]
====
Pipelines as Code is a Technology Preview feature.
====

With Pipelines as Code, cluster administrators and users with the required privileges can define pipeline templates as part of source code Git repositories. When triggered by a source code push or a pull request for the configured Git repository, the feature runs the pipeline and reports status.

Pipelines as Code supports the following features:

* Pull request status. When iterating over a pull request, the status and control of the pull request is exercised on the platform hosting the Git repository.

* GitHub checks the API to set the status of a pipeline run, including rechecks.

* GitHub pull request and commit events. 

* Pull request actions in comments, such as `/retest`.

* Git events filtering, and a separate pipeline for each event.

* Automatic task resolution in {pipelines-shortname} for local tasks, Tekton Hub, and remote URLs.

* Use of GitHub blobs and objects API for retrieving configurations.

* Access Control List (ACL) over a GitHub organization, or using a Prow-style `OWNER` file.

* The `tkn-pac` plugin for the `tkn` CLI tool, which you can use to manage {pac} repositories and bootstrapping.

* Support for GitHub Application, GitHub Webhook, Bitbucket Server, and Bitbucket Cloud.

[id="deprecated-features-1-7_{context}"]
== Deprecated features

// Pipelines
* Breaking change: The `disable-working-directory-overwrite` and `disable-home-env-overwrite` fields in the `TektonConfig` custom resource (CR) is removed. As a result, the `$HOME` environment variable and `workingDir` parameter are unavailable.
// https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/pull/4587

* The `Conditions` custom resource definition (CRD) type is deprecated and planned to be removed in a future release. Instead, use the recommended `When` expression.
// issue # unknown; discussed in Slack.

// Triggers
* Breaking change: The `Triggers` resource validates the templates and generates an error if you do not specify the `EventListener` and `TriggerBinding` values.
// https://github.com/tektoncd/triggers/pull/1277 and https://github.com/tektoncd/triggers/pull/1264


[id="known-issues-1-7_{context}"]
== Known issues

// Pipelines
* Implicit parameter mapping incorrectly passes parameters from the top-level `Pipeline` or `PipelineRun` definitions to the `taskRef` tasks. Mapping should only occur from a top-level resource to tasks with in-line `taskSpec` specifications. This issue only affects users who have set the `enable-api-fields` feature flag to `alpha`.


[id="fixed-issues-1-7_{context}"]
== Fixed issues

// Pipelines
* With this update, metadata such as `labels` and `annotations` from task and pipeline definitions does not propagate to task runs and pipeline runs.
// https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/pull/4478

* With this update, if the `timeouts.tasks` field or the `timeouts.finally` field is set to `0`, then the `timeouts.pipeline` is also set to `0`. 
// https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/pull/4539

* With this update, the `-x` set flag is removed from scripts that do not use a shebang. The fix reduces potential data leak from script execution.
// https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/pull/4451

* With this update, any backslash character present in the usernames in Git credentials is escaped with an additional backslash in the `.gitconfig` file.
// https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/pull/4337

// Triggers
* With this update, the `finalizer` property of the `EventListener` object is not necessary for cleaning up logging and config maps.
// https://github.com/tektoncd/triggers/pull/1244

* With this update, the default HTTP client associated with the event listener server is removed, and a custom HTTP client added. As a result, the timeouts have improved.
// https://github.com/tektoncd/triggers/pull/1308

* With this update, the Triggers cluster role now works with owner references.
// https://github.com/tektoncd/triggers/pull/1267

* With this update, the race condition in the event listener does not happen when multiple interceptors return extensions.
// https://github.com/tektoncd/triggers/pull/1282

// CLI
* With this update, the `tkn pr delete` command does not delete the pipeline runs with the `ignore-running` flag.
// https://github.com/tektoncd/cli/pull/1532

// Operator
* With this update, the Operator pods do not continue restarting when you modify any add-on parameters.
// https://github.com/tektoncd/operator/pull/631

* With this update, the `tkn serve` CLI pod is scheduled on infra nodes, if not configured in the subscription and config custom resources.
// https://github.com/tektoncd/operator/pull/544

* With this update, cluster tasks with specified versions are not deleted during upgrade.
// https://github.com/tektoncd/operator/pull/599
