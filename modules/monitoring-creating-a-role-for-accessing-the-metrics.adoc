= Creating a role for accessing the metrics

By default, only cluster administrator users have access to metrics from your services. Using the soft tenancy feature, you can also grant metrics access to an arbitrary user, who only has access to a particular project. This procedure shows how to create a role that gives access to metrics from your services.

.Prerequisites

* You need deploy the service that you want to monitor. This example uses the application described in "Deploying a sample service".
* You need to enable monitoring your own services.
* You need to have a user created.

.Procedure

. Create a YAML file for the new role. In this example, it is called `custom-metrics-role.yaml`.

. Fill the file with the configuration for the alerting rules:
+
[source,yaml]
----
FIXME role configuration
----
+
This configuration creates the FIXME role, which gives access FIXME.

. Apply the configuration file to the cluster:
+
----
$ oc apply -f custom-metrics-role.yaml
----
+
Now the role is created.
