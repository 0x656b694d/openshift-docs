= Configuring OperatorHub for restricted networks

Cluster administrators can configure OLM and OperatorHub to use local content in
a restricted network environment using a custom Operator catalog image. For this
example, the procedure uses a custom `redhat-operators` catalog image previously
built and pushed to supported registry.

.Prerequisites

* A Linux workstation with unrestricted network access
ifeval::["{context}" == "olm-restricted-networks"]
footnoteref:[BZ1771329]
endif::[]
* A custom Operator catalog image pushed to a supported registry
* `oc` version 4.3+
* `podman` version 1.5.1+
* Access to mirror registry that supports
link:https://docs.docker.com/registry/spec/manifest-v2-2/[Docker v2-2], which
must be exposed with a certificate that is trusted by the workstation

.Procedure

. Disable the default OperatorSources by adding `disableAllDefaultSources: true` to the spec:
+
----
$ oc patch OperatorHub cluster --type json \
    -p '[{"op": "add", "path": "/spec/disableAllDefaultSources", "value": true}]'
----
+
This disables the default OperatorSources that are configured by default during
an {product-title} installation.

. Extract the contents of your custom Operator catalog image to generate manifests
required for mirroring:
+
----
$ oc adm catalog mirror \
    <registry_host_name>:<port>/<namespace>/redhat-operators:v1 \ <1>
    <registry_host_name>:<port>/openshift <2>

mirroring ...
----
<1> Specify your Operator catalog image.
<2> Specify a namespace to mirror all referenced images.
+
This generates an ImageContentSourcePolicy object that can configure nodes to
translate between the image references stored in Operator manifests and the
mirrored registry. A `mapping.txt` file is also created that which contains all
of the source images and where to map them to in the target registry. This file
is compatible with `oc image mirror` and can be used to further customize the
mirroring configuration.
+
By default, these files are created in the `./manifests` directory:
+
----
$ ls ./manifests
imageContentSourcePolicy.yaml
mapping.txt
----

. Apply the manifests:
+
----
$ oc apply -f ./manifests
----
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
If any invalid source tags are found, remove the offending mappings from your
`mapping.txt` file and pass the file to the `oc image mirror` command to
continue.
====

. Verify the CatalogSource and package manifest are created successfully:
+
----
# oc get pods -n openshift-marketplace
NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE
my-operator-catalog-6njx6 1/1 Running 0 28s
marketplace-operator-d9f549946-96sgr 1/1 Running 0 26h

# oc get catalogsource -n openshift-marketplace
NAME DISPLAY TYPE PUBLISHER AGE
my-operator-catalog My Operator Catalog grpc 5s

# oc get packagemanifest -n openshift-marketplace
NAME CATALOG AGE
etcd My Operator Catalog 34s
----
+
You should also be able to view them from the *OperatorHub* page in the web
console.

You can now install the Operator from the OperatorHub on your restricted network
{product-title} cluster.
