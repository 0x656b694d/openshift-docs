= Configuring OperatorHub for restricted networks

Cluster administrators can configure OLM and OperatorHub to use local content in
a restricted network environment using a custom Operator catalog image. For this
example, the procedure uses a custom `redhat-operators` catalog image previously
built and pushed to a supported registry.

.Prerequisites

* A Linux workstation with unrestricted network access
ifeval::["{context}" == "olm-restricted-networks"]
footnoteref:[BZ1771329]
endif::[]
* A custom Operator catalog image pushed to a supported registry
* `oc` version 4.3.5+
* `podman` version 1.4.4+
* Access to mirror registry that supports
link:https://docs.docker.com/registry/spec/manifest-v2-2/[Docker v2-2]
* If you are working with private registries, set the `REG_CREDS` environment
variable to the file path of your registry credentials for use in later steps.
For example, for the `podman` CLI:
+
----
$ REG_CREDS=${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR}/containers/auth.json
----

.Procedure

. Disable the default OperatorSources by adding `disableAllDefaultSources: true`
to the spec:
+
----
$ oc patch OperatorHub cluster --type json \
    -p '[{"op": "add", "path": "/spec/disableAllDefaultSources", "value": true}]'
----
+
This disables the default OperatorSources that are configured by default during
an {product-title} installation.

. The `oc adm catalog mirror` command extracts the contents of your custom
Operator catalog image to generate the manifests required for mirroring. You can
choose to either:
+
--
* Allow the default behavior of the command to automatically mirror all of the
image content to your mirror registry after generating manifests, or
* Add the `--manifests-only` flag to only generate the manifests required for
mirroring, but do not actually mirror the image content to a registry yet. This
can be useful for reviewing what will be mirrored, and it allows you to make any
changes to the mapping list if you only require a subset of the content. You can
then use that file with the `oc image mirror` command to mirror the modified
list of images in a later step.
--
+
On your workstation with unrestricted network access, run the following command:
+
----
$ oc adm catalog mirror \
    <registry_host_name>:<port>/olm/redhat-operators:v1 \//<1>
    <registry_host_name>:<port> \
    [-a ${REG_CREDS}] \//<2>
    [--insecure] \//<3>
    [--filter-by-os="<os>/<arch>"] \//<4>
    [--manifests-only] <5>
----
<1> Specify your Operator catalog image.
<2> Optional: If required, specify the location of your registry credentials
file.
<3> Optional: If you do not want to configure trust for the target registry, add
the `--insecure` flag.
<4> Optional: Because the catalog might reference images that support multiple
architectures and operating systems, you can filter by architecture and
operating system to mirror only the images that match. Valid values are
`linux/amd64`, `linux/ppc64le`, and `linux/s390x`.
<5> Optional: Only generate the manifests required for mirroring and do not actually
mirror the image content to a registry.
+
After running the command, a `<image_name>-manifests/` directory is created in
the current directory and generates the following files:
+
--
* The `imageContentSourcePolicy.yaml` file defines an ImageContentSourcePolicy
object that can configure nodes to translate between the image references stored
in Operator manifests and the mirrored registry.
* The `mapping.txt` file contains all of the source images and where to map them
in the target registry. This file is compatible with the `oc image mirror`
command and can be used to further customize the mirroring configuration.
--

. If you used the `--manifests-only` flag in the previous step and want to mirror
only a subset of the content:

.. Modify the list of images in your `mapping.txt` file to your
specifications.

.. Still on your workstation with unrestricted network access, use your modified
`mapping.txt` file to mirror the images to your registry using the `oc image
mirror` command:
+
----
$ oc image mirror \
    [-a ${REG_CREDS}] \
    -f ./redhat-operators-manifests/mapping.txt
----

. Apply the ImageContentSourcePolicy:
+
----
$ oc apply -f ./redhat-operators-manifests/imageContentSourcePolicy.yaml
----

. Create a CatalogSource object that references your catalog image.

.. Modify the following to your specifications and save it as a
`catalogsource.yaml` file:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
kind: CatalogSource
metadata:
  name: my-operator-catalog
  namespace: openshift-marketplace
spec:
  sourceType: grpc
  image: <registry_host_name>:<port>/olm/redhat-operators:v1 <1>
  displayName: My Operator Catalog
  publisher: grpc
----
<1> Specify your custom Operator catalog image.

.. Use the file to create the CatalogSource object:
+
----
$ oc create -f catalogsource.yaml
----

. Verify the following resources are created successfully.

.. Check the Pods:
+
----
$ oc get pods -n openshift-marketplace
----
+
.Example output
----
NAME                                    READY   STATUS    RESTARTS  AGE
my-operator-catalog-6njx6               1/1     Running   0         28s
marketplace-operator-d9f549946-96sgr    1/1     Running   0         26h
----

.. Check the CatalogSource:
+
----
$ oc get catalogsource -n openshift-marketplace
----
+
.Example output
----
NAME                  DISPLAY               TYPE PUBLISHER  AGE
my-operator-catalog   My Operator Catalog   grpc            5s
----

.. Check the PackageManifest:
+
----
$ oc get packagemanifest -n openshift-marketplace
----
+
.Example output
----
NAME    CATALOG              AGE
etcd    My Operator Catalog  34s
----

You can now install the Operators from the *OperatorHub* page on your restricted
network {product-title} cluster web console.
