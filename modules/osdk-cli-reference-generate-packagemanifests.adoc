= packagemanifests

Running `generate packagemanifests` subcommand is the first step to publishing your Operator to a catalog, deploying
it with OLM or both. This command generates a set of manifests in a versioned directory and a package manifest file for
your Operator. You must run `generate kustomize manifests` first to regenerate Kustomize bases
consumed by this command.
