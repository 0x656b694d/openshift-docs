= Accessing an example Node Tuning Operator specification

Use this process to access an example Node Tuning Operator specification.

.Procedure

 . Run:
+
----
$ oc get Tuned/default -o yaml -n openshift-cluster-node-tuning-operator
----

The default CR is meant for delivering standard node-level tuning for the
{product-title} platform and it can only be modified to set the Operator
Management state. Any other custom changes to the default CR will be
overwritten by the Operator. For custom tuning, create your own Tuned CRs. Newly
created CRs will be combined with the default CR and custom tuning applied to
{product-title} nodes based on node or Pod labels and profile priorities.
