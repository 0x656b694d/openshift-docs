= About DataVolumes

`DataVolume` objects are custom resources provided by the Containerized Data
Importer (CDI) project. DataVolumes orchestrate import, clone, and upload
operations associated with an underlying PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC).
DataVolumes are integrated with KubeVirt, and they can prevent a virtual machine
from being started before the PVC has been prepared.
