= Enabling TPM v2 disk encryption
Use the following procedure to enable TPM v2 mode disk encryption during an {product-title} installation.

[NOTE]
====
On previous versions of {op-system}, disk encryption was configured by specifying `/etc/clevis.json` in the Ignition config. That file is not supported in clusters created with {product-title} 4.7 or above, and the LUKS device should be configured directly via the Ignition `luks` section.
====

.Prerequisites

* You have downloaded the {product-title} installation program on your installation node.

.Procedure

. Check to see if TPM v2 encryption needs to be enabled in the BIOS on each node. This is required on most Dell systems. Check the manual for your computer.

. On your installation node, change to the directory that contains the installation program and generate the Kubernetes manifests for the cluster:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ./openshift-install create manifests --dir <installation_directory> <1>
----
<1> Replace `<installation_directory>` with the path to the directory that you want to store the installation files in.

. Create machine config files to encrypt the boot disks for the control plane or compute nodes using the TPM v2 encryption mode. 
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
If you are also configuring boot disk mirroring on the affected nodes, skip this step. You will configure disk encryption when configuring boot disk mirroring.
====

** To configure encryption on the control plane nodes, save the following machine config sample to a file in the `<installation_directory>/openshift` directory. For example, name the file `99-openshift-master-tpmv2-encryption.yaml`:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/v1

          wipeFilesystem: true
          label: root
----
<1> Set this attribute to `true` to use a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) secure cryptoprocessor to encrypt the root file system.
+
** To configure encryption on the compute nodes, save the following machine config sample to a file in the `<installation_directory>/openshift` directory. For example, name the file `99-openshift-worker-tpmv2-encryption.yaml`:
+
[source,yaml]

          clevis:
            tpm2: true <1>
          options: [--cipher, aes-cbc-essiv:sha256]

        - device: /dev/mapper/root
          format: xfs
          wipeFilesystem: true
          label: root
----
<1> Set this attribute to `true` to use a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) secure cryptoprocessor to encrypt the root file system.

. Create a backup copy of the YAML files. The original YAML files are consumed when you create the Ignition config files.

. Continue with the remainder of the {product-title} deployment.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you configure additional data partitions, they will not be encrypted unless encryption is explicitly requested.
