= Understanding how {product-title} differs from {OCP}


{product-title} uses the same code base as {OCP} but is installed in an opinionated way to be optimized for performance, scalability, and security. {product-title} is a fully managed service, therefore many of the {product-title} components and settings that you manually set up in {OCP} are set up for you by default.

Review the following differences between {product-title} and a standard installation of {OCP} on your own infrastructure:


[options="header"]
|====
|{OCP} |{product-title}

|The customer installs and configures {OCP}.
|Red Hat installs {product-title}  in a standardized way that's optimized for performance, scalability, and security.

|Customers can choose their computing resources.
|Red Hat hosts {product-title}  in a public cloud (Amazon Web Services or Google Cloud) and manages it directly.

|Customers have top-level administrative access to the infrastructure.
|Customers have a built-in administrator group, though they can request top-level administration access from Red Hat.

|Customers can use all supported features and configuration settings available in Red Hat OpenShift.
|Some {OCP} features and configuration settings may not be available or changeable in {product-title} .

|You set up control plane components like the API server and etcd on machines that get the `control` role. You can modify the control plane components, but keep in mind that you are responsible for backing up, restoring, and making control plane data highly available.
|Red Hat sets up the control, manages the control plane components, and automatically applies control patch updates for you. The controls are highly available and backed up automatically.

|You are responsible for updating the underlying infrastructure for the control and worker nodes. You can use the OpenShift web console to update {OCP} versions.
|Red Hat automatically applies updates to the control, and provides version updates and security patch updates for the worker nodes. You can use the OpenShift web console to update {product-title} versions.

|Support is provided per the terms of your Red Hat subscription or cloud provider.
|Engineered, operated, and supported by Red Hat with a 99.95% uptime SLA and link:https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/openshift/sla[24x7] coverage.
