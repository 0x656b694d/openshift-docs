= Limited support status

When a cluster transitions to a _Limited Support_ status, it means that the SLA is no longer applicable and credits requested against the SLA are denied. It does not mean that you no longer have product support. You can return the cluster to a fully-supported status by remediating the violating factors.

A cluster transitions to a Limited Support status in the following scenarios:

If you do not upgrade a cluster to a supported version before the end-of-life date:: Red Hat does not make any runtime or SLA guarantees for versions after their end-of-life date. To receive continued support, upgrade the cluster to a supported version within the 9-month period. If you do not upgrade the cluster within the 9-month period, the cluster transitions to a Limited Support status until you upgrade it to a supported version.
+
Red Hat provides commercially reasonable support to upgrade from an unsupported version to a supported version. However, if a supported upgrade path is no longer available, you might have to create a new cluster and migrate your workloads.

If you remove or replace any native {product-title} components or any other component that is installed and managed by Red Hat:: If you used the cluster administrator rights, Red Hat is not responsible for any of your or your authorized usersâ€™ actions, including those that affect infrastructure services, service availability, or data loss. If Red Hat detects any such actions, the cluster transitions to a Limited Support status. Red Hat notifies you of the status change and you should either revert the action or create a support case to remediate the issue.

If you have questions about the violating factors that cause a cluster to transition to a Limited Support status or need further assistance, open a support ticket.
