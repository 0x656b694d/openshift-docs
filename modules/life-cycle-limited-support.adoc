= Limited support status

While operating outside of the supported versions list, you might be asked to upgrade the cluster to a supported version when requesting support, unless you are within the 30-day grace period after version deprecation. Additionally, Red Hat does not make any runtime or SLA guarantees for clusters outside of the supported versions list at the end of the 30-day grace period.

Red Hat provides best effort to ensure an upgrade path from an unsupported release to a supported release is available. However, if a supported upgrade path is no longer available, you might be required to create a new cluster and migrate your workloads.

// TODO: Legal guidelines say to avoid the term "best effort": https://source.redhat.com/groups/public/customerplatform/cee_customer_platform_wiki/legal_guidelines_for_all_customer_portal_content suggests some alternatives, like "commercially resonable support"
