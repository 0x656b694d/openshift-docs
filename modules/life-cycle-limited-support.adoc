= Limited support status

While operating outside of the supported versions list, you might be asked to upgrade the cluster to a supported version when requesting support, unless you are within the 30-day grace period after version deprecation. Additionally, Red Hat does not make any runtime or SLA guarantees for clusters outside of the supported versions list at the end of the 30-day grace period.

Red Hat will provide best effort to ensure an upgrade path from an unsupported release to a supported release is available. However, if a supported upgrade path is no longer available, you might be required to create a new cluster and migrate your workloads.
