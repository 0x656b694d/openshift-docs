= Descheduler strategies

The following descheduler strategies are available:

Low node utilization::
The `LowNodeUtilization` strategy finds nodes that are underutilized and evicts pods, if possible, from other nodes in the hope that recreation of evicted pods will be scheduled on these underutilized nodes.
+
The underutilization of nodes is determined by several configurable threshold parameters: CPU, memory, and number of pods. If a node's usage is below the configured thresholds for all parameters (CPU, memory, and number of pods), then the node is considered to be underutilized.
+
You can also set a target threshold for CPU, memory, and number of pods. If a node's usage is above the configured target thresholds for any of the parameters, then the node's pods might be considered for eviction.
+
Additionally, you can use the `nodes` parameter to set the strategy to activate only when the number of underutilized nodes is above the configured value. This can be helpful in large clusters where a few nodes might be underutilized frequently or for a short period of time.

Duplicate pods::
The `RemoveDuplicates` strategy ensures that there is only one pod associated with a replica set, replication controller, deployment, or job running on same node. If there are more, then those duplicate pods are evicted for better spreading of pods in a cluster.
+
This situation could occur after a node failure, when a pod is moved to another node, leading to more than one pod associated with a replica set, replication controller, deployment, or job on that node. After the failed node is ready again, this strategy evicts the duplicate pod.

Violation of inter-pod anti-affinity::
The `RemovePodsViolatingInterPodAntiAffinity` strategy ensures that pods violating inter-pod anti-affinity are removed from nodes.
+
This situation could occur when anti-affinity rules are created for pods that are already running on the same node.

Violation of node affinity::
The `RemovePodsViolatingNodeAffinity` strategy ensures that pods violating node affinity are removed from nodes.
+
This situation could occur if a node no longer satisfies a pod's affinity rule. If another node is available that satisfies the affinity rule, then the pod is evicted.

Violation of node taints::
The `RemovePodsViolatingNodeTaints` strategy ensures that pods violating `NoSchedule` taints on nodes are removed.
+
This situation could occur if a pod is set to tolerate a taint `key=value:NoSchedule` and is running on a tainted node. If the node's taint is updated or removed, the taint is no longer satisfied by the pod's tolerations and the pod is evicted.
