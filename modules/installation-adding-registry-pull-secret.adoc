= Configuring credentials that allow images to be mirrored

Create a container image registry credentials file that allows mirroring
images from Red Hat to your mirror.

ifdef::restricted[]
[WARNING]
====
Do not use this image registry credentials file as the pull secret when you install a cluster. If you provide this file when you install cluster, all of the machines in the cluster will have write access to your mirror registry.
====
endif::restricted[]

ifdef::restricted[]
[WARNING]
====
This process requires that you have write access to a container image registry on the mirror registry and adds the credentials to a registry pull secret.
====

endif::restricted[]

ifdef::restricted[]
