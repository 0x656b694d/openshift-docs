= Changes in {VirtProductName} behavior on a single node cluster

You can use {VirtProductName} with single node clusters, also known as single-node OpenShift. These clusters are not configured for high-availability operation, which results in significant changes to {VirtProductName} behavior.

* {VirtProductName} components have only one replica, and pod disruption budgets do not apply.
* Live migration is not supported.
