= Configuring guest memory overcommitment

If your virtual workload requires more memory than available, you can
use memory overcommitment to allocate all or most of the hostâ€™s memory
to your virtual machine instances (VMIs). Enabling memory overcommitment means
you can maximize resources that are normally reserved for the host.

For example, if the host has 32 GB RAM, you can use memory
overcommitment to fit 8 VMs with 4 GB RAM each. This allocation works under the
assumption that the VMs will not use all of their memory at the same
time.


.Procedure

. To explicitly tell the VMI that it has more memory available than
was requested from the cluster, edit the virtual machine configuration file and
set `spec.domain.memory.guest` to a higher value than
`spec.domain.resources.requests.memory`. This process is called memory
overcommitment.
+
In this example, `1024M` is requested from the cluster, but the VMI is
told that it has `2048M` available. As long as there is enough free memory
available on the node, the VMI will consume up to 2048M.

The same eviction rules as those for Pods apply to the VMI if
the node is under memory pressure.
