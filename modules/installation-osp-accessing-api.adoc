[id="installation-osp-accessing-api_{context}"]
= Enabling access to the environment

At deployment, all {product-title} machines are created in a Red Hat OpenStack Platform (RHOSP)-tenant network. Therefore, they are not accessible directly in most RHOSP deployments.

You can configure the {product-title} API to be accessible either with or without floating IP addresses.
