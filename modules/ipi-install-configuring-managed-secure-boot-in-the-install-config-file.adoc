= Configuring managed Secure Boot in the `install-config.yaml` file (optional)

You can enable managed Secure Boot when deploying an installer-provisioned cluster using Redfish BMC addressing, such as `redfish`, `redfish-virtualmedia`, or `idrac-virtualmedia`. To enable managed Secure Boot, add the `bootMode` configuration setting to each node:

[source,yaml]
.Example
----
hosts:
  - name: openshift-master-0
    role: master
    bmc:
      address: redfish://<out_of_band_ip> <1>
      username: <user>
      password: <password>
    bootMACAddress: <NIC1_mac_address>
    rootDeviceHints:
     deviceName: "/dev/sda"
    bootMode: UEFISecureBoot <2>
----

<1> Ensure the `bmc.address` setting uses `redfish`, `redfish-virtualmedia`, or `idrac-virtualmedia` as the protocol. For additional information, see "BMC addressing for HPE iLO" or "BMC addressing for Dell iDRAC".
<2> The `bootMode` setting is `UEFI` by default. To enable managed Secure Boot, change it to `UEFISecureBoot`.

[NOTE]
====
To ensure the nodes can support managed Secure Boot, see "Configuring nodes" in the "Prerequisites". If the nodes do not support managed Secure Boot, see "Configuring nodes for Secure Boot manually" in the "Configuring nodes" section. Configuring Secure Boot manually requires Redfish virtual media.

[NOTE]
====
Red Hat does not support Secure Boot with IPMI because IPMI does not provide Secure Boot management facilities.
