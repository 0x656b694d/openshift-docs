= Creating more {op-system-first} machines by PXE or iPXE booting

You can create more compute machines for your bare metal cluster by using PXE or iPXE booting.

.Prerequisites

* Obtain the URL of the Ignition config file for the compute machines for your cluster. You uploaded this file to your HTTP server during installation.
* Obtain the URLs of the {op-system} ISO image, compressed metal BIOS, `kernel`, and `initramfs` files that you uploaded to your HTTP server during cluster installation.
* You have access to the PXE booting infrastructure that you used to create the machines for your {product-title} cluster during installation. The machines must boot from their local disks after {op-system} is installed on them.
* If you use UEFI, you have access to the `grub.conf` file that you modified during {product-title} installation.

.Procedure

. Confirm that your PXE or iPXE installation for the {op-system} images is correct.

** For PXE:

DEFAULT pxeboot
TIMEOUT 20
PROMPT 0
LABEL pxeboot
    KERNEL http://<HTTP_server>/rhcos-<version>-installer-kernel-<architecture> <1>
    APPEND ip=dhcp rd.neednet=1 initrd=http://<HTTP_server>/rhcos-<version>-installer-initramfs.<architecture>.img coreos.inst=yes coreos.inst.install_dev=sda coreos.inst.image_url=http://<HTTP_server>/rhcos-<version>-metal.<architecture>.raw.gz coreos.inst.ignition_url=http://<HTTP_server>/worker.ign <2> <3>
----
<1> Specify the location of the `kernel` file that you uploaded to your HTTP server.
<2> If you use multiple NICs, specify a single interface in the `ip` option. For example, to use DHCP on a NIC that is named `eno1`, set `ip=eno1:dhcp`.
<3> Specify locations of the {op-system} files that you uploaded to your HTTP server. The `initrd` parameter value is the location of the `initramfs` file, the `coreos.inst.image_url` parameter value is the location of the compressed metal RAW image, and the `coreos.inst.ignition_url` parameter value is the location of the worker Ignition config file.

[NOTE]
====
This configuration does not enable serial console access on machines with a graphical console.  To configure a different console, add one or more `console=` arguments to the `APPEND` line.  For example, add `console=tty0 console=ttyS0` to set the first PC serial port as the primary console and the graphical console as a secondary console.
