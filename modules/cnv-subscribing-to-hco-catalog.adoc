= Subscribing to the KubeVirt HyperConverged Cluster Operator catalog

Before you install {CNVProductName}, subscribe to the
*KubeVirt HyperConverged Cluster Operator* catalog from
the {product-title} web console. Subscribing gives the `openshift-cnv`
namespace access to the {CNVProductName} Operators.

.Prerequisites

* `OperatorGroup` and `CatalogSource` Custom Resource Definition objects (CRDs),
both created in the `openshift-cnv` namespace

.Procedure

. Navigate in the web console to the *Operators â†’ OperatorHub* page.

. Scroll or type a keyword into the *Filter by keyword* box to find the KubeVirt
HyperConverged Cluster Operator, then click on it.

. Read the information about the Operator and click *Install*.

. On the *Create Operator Subscription* page:
.. Select one of the following:
*** *All namespaces on the cluster (default)* installs the Operator in the default
`openshift-operators` namespace to watch and be made available to all namespaces
in the cluster. This option is not always available.
*** *A specific namespace on the cluster* allows you to choose a specific, single
namespace in which to install the Operator. The Operator will only watch and be
made available for use in this single namespace.

. Click *Subscribe* to make the Operator available to the selected namespaces on
this {product-title} cluster.
