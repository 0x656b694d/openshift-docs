= Creating the {op-system-first} image

The {product-title} installation program requires that a {op-system-first} image be present in the {rh-openstack-first} cluster. Retrieve the latest {op-system} image, then upload it using the {rh-openstack} CLI.

.Prerequisites

* The {rh-openstack} CLI is installed.

.Procedure

. Download the latest {op-system} image from the Red Hat customer portal's https://access.redhat.com/downloads/content/290[Product Downloads page].
+
[NOTE]
The {rh-openstack} QCOW2 images are delivered in compressed format, so you must specify additional options to download them.  With `curl`, specify `curl --compressed -J -L -O <image_url>`.  With `wget`, specify `wget --compression=auto <image_url>`.

. From the image that you downloaded, create an image that is named `rhcos` to your cluster by using the {rh-openstack} CLI:
+
----
$ openstack image create --container-format=bare --disk-format=qcow2 --file rhcos-${RHCOSVERSION}-openstack.qcow2 rhcos
----
+
[CAUTION]
If the installation program finds multiple images with the same name, it chooses one of them at random. To avoid this behavior, create unique names for resources in {rh-openstack}.
+
[NOTE]
Depending on your {rh-openstack} environment, the image can be in either `qcow2` or `raw` formats. Some environments do not support the `qcow2` format (e.g., Red Hat Ceph Storage link:https://access.redhat.com/solutions/2434691[only supports the `raw` format]). If your environment requires the `raw` format, substitute `raw` for `qcow2` in the preceding example. For more information about image formats, see link:https://docs.openstack.org/glance/latest/user/formats.html[Disk and container formats for images].

After you upload the image to {rh-openstack}, it is available to the installation program.
