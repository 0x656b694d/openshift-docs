= Managing Feature Flags

== Prerequisites
* You have access to the environment where the {product-title-short} component is deployed.
* You have permission to modify environment variables.
* You understand the differences between `dev-preview` and `tech-preview` release stages. For more information see the link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/6966848[Developer and Technology Previews: How they compare].
* You know if the feature flag needs to be configured before the deployment. Check the installation manifests to see if they use the required flag.

.Procedure

. Identify the environment variable name, associated with the feature flag.
Consult the release notes or the `/v1/featureflags` API endpoint to identify the flag for the feature you want to enable or disable.

. Modify the feature flag by completing one of the following actions:
* To enable a feature, configure the environment variable associated with the flag by setting its value to `true`.
* To disable a feature, set the environment variable associated with the flag to `false`.

. After the application is restarted or redeployed, verify that the feature has been enabled or disabled by completing the following steps:
Once the application is restarted or redeployed, verify that the feature has been enabled or disabled as intended:

* Check the output of the `/v1/featureflags` API endpoint.
* Check the application functionality related to the feature.
* Review logs or monitoring tools for any errors or confirmation messages.

== Best Practices
* *Dev-Preview*: Do not enable dev-preview features.
* *Testing:* Always test feature changes in a staging environment before applying them to production.
* *Documentation:* Keep a record of all feature flags and their current status.
* *Rollback:* Be prepared to revert the changes if the feature causes issues.

== Troubleshooting
Follow these troubleshooting guidelines:
* If the feature does not appear, ensure that the environment variable is correctly named and set. Check application logs for any errors related to feature flag parsing.
* If enabling a feature causes application errors, disable the feature and contact support.
