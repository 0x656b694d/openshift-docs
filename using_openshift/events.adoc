== Overview

OpenShift Events model events that happen to API objects in an OpenShift cluster.  Events allow the
system to record information about real-world events in a resource-agnostic manner and allow users
and administrators to consume information about system components in a unified way.

== Querying events with the CLI

This section will be expanded as more information becomes available

== Viewing events in the console

This section will be expanded as more information becomes available

== Out-of-band interface

// NOT YET IMPLEMENTED

OpenShift administrators may want to consume events directly via an out-of-band interface instead
of querying the API server.  One use-case for this is the case where the API server cannot be
contacted by a system component in order to record events.

This section will be expanded as more information becomes available
