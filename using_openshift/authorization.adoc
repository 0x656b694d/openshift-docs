== Overview
*Authorization is still in the experimental stage, so the API, command line, and rule expressions are subject to change or removal without notice.*

Authorization determines whether an identity is allowed to perform any action. Note that authorization is a separate step from authentication, which is more about determining who (identity) is taking the action.

Authorization is managed using rules, roles, and bindings. A rule describes the permission that each user has in relation to performing an action, and a role is a collection of rules. Users and groups may be bound to multiple roles at the same time. Lastly, a binding associates a role with a list of users and groups, and decides which rules apply to which user. 

Several factors are combined to make the decision when authorization is evaluated:

* *Identity*: Both the username and list of groups the user belongs to.
* *Action*: The action being performed. In most cases, this consists of: 
** *Project*: The project being accessed.
** *Verb*: get, list, create, update, etc
** *Resource*: The API endpoint being accessed. This is distinct from the resource being touched, such as pods, deploymentconfigs, builds, etc..
* *Bindings*: The full list of bindings.

The evaluation goes through the following steps:

. Use the identity and the action.project to find all bindings that apply to the user or their groups.
. Use the bindings to locate all the roles that apply.
. Use the roles to find all the rules that apply.
. Check the action against each rule to find an allow or deny match.
. If no matching rule is found, the action is then denied by default.


== Roles
OpenShift includes four global roles out of the box:

* *Cluster-admin*: A super-user that can perform any action in any project.
* *Admin*: A user with enough power to manage a project. If used in a local binding, an admin user will have rights to view any resource in the project and modify any resource in the project except for role creation and quota.  If the cluster-admin wants to allow an admin to modify roles, the cluster-admin must create a project scoped Policy object.
* *Edit*: A user that can modify most objects in a project, but does not have the power to view or modify roles or bindings.
* *View*: A user who cannot make any modifications, but can see most objects in a project. They cannot view or modify roles or bindings.

If you find that these roles do not suit you, global roles can be created, modified, or deleted via osc.


== Global Roles and Bindings
There are two levels of roles and bindings: global and local (project scoped). This two level hierarchy allows re-usability over multiple projects while allowing controlled customization inside of individual projects. Local bindings can reference both global and local roles. Global bindings can only reference global roles.

During evaluation both the global bindings and the local bindings are used, in that order. The search order also ensures that a global allow overrides a local deny. For example:

. Globally bound deny rules are checked.
. Globally bound allow rules are checked.
. Locally bound deny rules are checked.
. Locally bound allow rules are checked.
. Deny by default.


Once authorization finds the correct rule, no other proceeding rules are checked. This is because rules bound to a user could cause conflicts. Only the first match is considered upon evaluation.

== Binding Users to Roles
*These commands are experimental and subject to change or removal without notice.*

Manage a user's associated roles with the following commands. A project may be specified with the --namespace flag. If it is not specified, then the default project is used:

[source]
---
openshift ex policy add-user <role> <username> [username]...
---

This binds the given role to the specified users inside of a given project. The role is assumed to be global, but can be specified using --role-namespace.

[source]
---
openshift ex policy remove-user <role> <username> [username]...
---

This removes the binding for the given role from the specified users inside of a given project. The role is assumed to be global, but can be specified using --role-namespace.

[source]
---
openshift ex policy remove-user-from-project <username> [username]...
---

This removes all bindings from the specified users inside of a given project.

[source]
---
openshift ex policy add-group <role> <groupname> [groupname]...
---

This binds the given role to the specified groups inside of a given project. The role-name is assumed to be global, but can be specified using --role-namespace.

[source]
---
openshift ex policy remove-group <role> <groupname> [groupname]...
---

This removes the binding for the given role from the specified groups inside of a given project. The role-name is assumed to be global, but can be specified using --role-namespace.

[source]
---
openshift ex policy remove-group-from-project <groupname> [groupname]...
---

This removes all bindings from the specified groups inside of a given project.
