== Overview
*Authorization is still in the experimental stage, so the API, CLI, and rule expression are subject to change or removal without notice.*

Authorization happens as a separate step from authentication.  Authentication determines who (identity) is taking the action, but authorizations determines whether that identity is allowed to perform the action.

Authorization is managed using rules, roles, and bindings.  A rule grants or denies the ability to perform an action.  A role is a collection of rules.  A binding associates a role with a list of users and groups.  Users and groups may be bound to multiple roles at the same time.

When authorization is evaluated, several pieces of information are combined to make the decision:

. Identity: Both username and list of all groups the user belongs to.
. Action: The action being performed.  In most cases, this consists of: 
.. project: The project being accessed.
.. verb: get, list, create, update, etc
.. resource: The API endpoint being accessed.  This is distinct from the kind of resource being touch.  pods, deploymentconfigs, builds, etc
. Bindings: The full list of all bindings.

The evaluation happens like so:

. Use the identity and the action.project to find all bindings that apply to the user or his groups.
. Use the bindings to locate all the roles that apply
. Use the roles to find all the rules that apply
. Check the action against each rule to find an allow or deny match

If no matching rule is found, the action is denied by default.


== Global Roles and Bindings
There are two levels of roles and bindings: global and local (project scoped).  This two level hierarchy allows re-usability over multiple projects while allowing controlled customization inside of individual projects.  Local bindings can reference both global and local roles.  Global bindings can only reference global roles.

During evaluation, both the local bindings and the global bindings are used.  Global bindings are used first, followed by the local bindings.  The search order looks like this:

. Check globally bound deny rules - short circuit on match.
. Check globally bound allow rules - short circuit on match.
. Check locally bound deny rules - short circuit on match.
. Check locally bound allow rules - short circuit on match.
. Deny by default.

This search order means that a global allow overrides a local deny.


== Default Roles
OpenShift includes four global roles out of the box.

. cluster-admin: cluster-admins are super-users that can perform any action in any project.
. admin: admins have enough power to manage a project. If used in a local binding, an admin user will have rights to view any resource in the project and modify any resource in the project except for role creation and quota.  If the cluster-admin wants to allow an admin to modify roles, the cluster-admin must create a project scoped Policy object.
. edit: editors can modify most objects in a project, but do not have the power to view or modify roles or bindings.
. view: viewer can't modify anything, but can see most objects in a project.  They cannot view or modify roles or bindings.

If you find that these roles do not suit you, global roles can be created, modified, or deleted via osc.


== Binding Users to Roles
*These commands are experimental are subject to change or removal without notice.*
In order to manage users their associated roles, you may use the following commands:

[source]
---
openshift ex policy add-user <role-name> <scope-qualified-username> [scope-qualified-username]...
openshift ex policy remove-user <role-name> <scope-qualified-username> [scope-qualified-username]...
openshift ex policy remove-user-from-project <scope-qualified-username> [scope-qualified-username]...
openshift ex policy add-group <role-name> <scope-qualified-groupname> [scope-qualified-groupname]...
openshift ex policy remove-group <role-name> <scope-qualified-groupname> [scope-qualified-groupname]...
openshift ex policy remove-group-from-project <scope-qualified-groupname> [scope-qualified-groupname]...
---

For all of those commands, the project may be specified with the --namespace flag.  If it is not specified, then "default" is used.

. add-user adds a binds the given role to the specified users inside of a given project.  role-name is assumed to be global, but can be specified using --role-namespace.
. remove-user removes the binding for the given role from the specified users inside of a given project.  role-name is assumed to be global, but can be specified using --role-namespace.
. remove-user-from-project removes all bindings from the specified users inside of a given project.
. add-group adds a binds the given role to the specified groups inside of a given project.  role-name is assumed to be global, but can be specified using --role-namespace.
. remove-group removes the binding for the given role from the specified groups inside of a given project.  role-name is assumed to be global, but can be specified using --role-namespace.
. remove-group-from-project removes all bindings from the specified groups inside of a given project.
