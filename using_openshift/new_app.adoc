== Overview
new-app creates a new application in OpenShift by specifying source code, templates, and/or images. It will try to build up the components of an application using images or code located on your system. It will lookup the images on the local Docker installation (if available), a Docker registry, or an OpenShift image stream. If you specify a source code URL, it will set up a build that takes your source code and converts it into an image that can run inside of a pod. The images will be deployed via a deployment configuration, and a service will be hooked up to the first public port of the app. Note that if you specify source code, you may need to run a build with 'start-build' after the application is created.
