== Overview

The `osc new-app` command creates a new application in OpenShift by specifying
source code, templates, and/or images. It tries to build up the components of an
application using images or code located on your system. It looks up the images
on the local Docker installation (if available), a Docker registry, or an
OpenShift image stream.

If you specify a source code URL, it sets up a build that takes your source code
and converts it into an image that can run inside of a pod. The images are
deployed via a deployment configuration, and a service is hooked up to the first
public port of the application.

NOTE: If you specify source code, you may need to
link:builds.html#starting-a-build[run a build] with `osc start-build` after the
application is created.

== Usage Examples

directory, run:

----
