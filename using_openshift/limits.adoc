== Overview

A *LimitRange* object enumerates min/max resource usage values per object in a project.

== Limits

A *LimitRange* object may enumerate the following limits for each object type and resource value that is created or modified in the project.  If a usage limit is defined, and the incoming resource exceeds the allowed range, the resource is forbidden from the project.

For some fields, in the absent of a value on the incoming resource, it is possible to apply a default value if specified on the *LimitRange* document.

|Type |ResourceName |Description |Default Value supported

|`Container`
|`cpu`
|min/max cpu allowed per container
|yes

|`Container`
|`memory`
|min/max memory allowed per container
|yes

|`Pod`
|`cpu`
|min/max cpu allowed across all containers in a pod
|no

|`Pod`
|`memory`
|min/max memory allowed across all containers in a pod
|no

== Limit enforcement

Once a *LimitRange* is created in a project, all resource create and modification requests are evaluated against each *LimitRange* document in the project.  If the resource violates a min/max constraint enumerated, then the resource is rejected.  If the resource does not set an explicit value, if the constraint supports a default value, the default value is applied to the resource.  For example, if the container does not express a cpu resource requirement, but the *LimitRange* specifies a default value for container cpu, the default value is set as the allowed cpu usage for that container, and the minimum (if specified) is set as the minimum requested value for that container.

== Creating a limit range

In order to apply a limit range to a project, you must use the following command:

****
`$ osc create -f limit-range.json`
****

== Viewing limits

In order to view limits enforced in the project, you must use the following command:

----
$ osc get limits
NAME
limits
$ osc describe limits limits
Name:           limits
Type            Resource        Min     Max     Default
----            --------        ---     ---     ---
Pod             memory          1Mi     1Gi     -
Pod             cpu             250m    2       -
Container       memory          1Mi     1Gi     1Mi
Container       cpu             250m    250m    250m
----

== Deleting limits

If you do not want to enforce limits in your project, you may remove any active limit range by name by issuing the following command:

****
`$ osc delete limits limits`
