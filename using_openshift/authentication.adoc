== Web Console authentication

The web console automatically redirects to `<master-public-addr>/oauth/authorize` to obtain a token to make API calls.

== Command-line authentication

Authentication from the command line is performed through the `osc login` command which features an interactive flow that will guide the user through establishing a session against an OpenShift server with the provided credentials, and will automatically save a config file that will be used by every subsequent command. 

There are many configuration options available for the `osc login` command, and you can access these with the `osc login --help` command. Here is a sample usage with the most common options:

----
$ osc login [--username=<username>]  [--password=<password>] [--server=<server>] [--certificate-authority=</path/to/file.crt>|--insecure-skip-tls-verify]
----

Notice that all configuration options are optional. That's because `osc login` int the only _interactive_ command in `osc`, meaning that if any information required to successfuly log in an OpenShift server were not provided, the command will _prompt_ for user input as required.

The following table describes some of the more common options.

|===

|Option |Description

.^|`-s, --server`
|This option allows you to specify the host name of the OpenShift server. If a server is provided through this flag, the command will not ask for it interactively. This flag can also be used if you _already_ have a config file and want to log in to _another_ server (switch servers).

.^|`-u, --username` and `-p, --password`
|This option allows you to specify the credentials to log in to the OpenShift server. If username or password are provided through these flags, the command will not ask for it interactively. These flags can also be used if you _already_ have a config file with a session token stablished and want to log in with _another_ username (switch users).

.^|`--certificate-authority`
|Used to correctly and securely authenticate with an OpenShift server that uses HTTPS. The path to a certificate authority file must be provided. 

.^|`--insecure-skip-tls-verify`
|This option allows interaction with an HTTPS server bypassing the server certificate checks; however, note that it is not secure. If you try to `osc login` to a HTTPS server that does not provide a valid certificate and this or the `--certificate-authority` flags were not provided, `osc login` will prompt for user input to confirm (`y/N` kind of input) about connecting insecurely.
