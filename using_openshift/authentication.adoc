== Web Console authentication

The web console automatically redirects to `<master-public-addr>/oauth/authorize` to obtain a token to make API calls.

== Command-line authentication

*Authentication is still in development, so the API, CLI, and configuration are subject to change.*

To get an API token:
----
$ openshift ex login
----

If the server is not configured to send WWW-Authenticate challenges, a token can be generated manually by visiting `<master-public-addr>/oauth/token/request` in their browser, then saved:
----
$ openshift ex config set-credentials MY_USER --token=MY_TOKEN
----
