== Overview
OpenShift builds can be triggered remotely using webhooks. Webhooks use custom HTTP callbacks to alter the behavior of a web page. The following types of webhooks are supported:

* https://developer.github.com/webhooks/[GitHub Webhooks]
* Generic Webhooks

== Displaying a build configuration's Webhook URLs

Use the `openshift cli describe buildConfig [replaceable]#<name>#` command to display the webhook URLs associated with a build configuration. If no webhook URLs are displayed, then no webhook trigger is defined for that build configuration.

== Using Github Webhooks

There are instructions for creating a GitHub webhook https://developer.github.com/webhooks/creating/[here]. The payload URL is returned as the GitHub webhook URL by the `describe` command.

== Using Generic Webhooks

Generic webhooks are used to trigger a build from a custom application. The webhook endpoint expects a JSON payload with the following formatting:

----
{
     type: 'git',
     git: {
        uri: '<url to git repository>',
	ref: '<optional git reference>',
	commit: '<commit hash identifying a specific git commit>',
	author: {
		name: '<author name>',
		email: '<author e-mail>',
	},
	committer: {
		name: '<committer name>',
		email: '<committer e-mail>',
	},
	message: '<commit message>'
     }
}
----

In order to trigger a build, a POST request must be made to the generic webhook URL of a particular build configuration. The POST request can include the following headers:

* `User-Agent` - (required) must have a non-empty value
* `Content-Length` - (optional) If included, a Content-Type header must also be included
* `Content-Type` - (optional) If Content-Length specified, must have 'application/json' as its value
