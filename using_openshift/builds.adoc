== Overview
A build is a process of creating runnable image to be used inside OpenShift.
We defined three types of builds:

* docker build
* STI build
* custom build.

These are described in more detail in the link:../architecture/builds.html[builds] topic.

== Build logs
Builds allow access to their logs using following command:

----
osc build-logs <buildID>
----

== Start build
Builds can be manually invoked using the following command:

----
osc start-build <buildConfigID>
----

Builds can be re-run using `--from-build` flag:

----
osc start-build --from-build=<buildID>
----

== Cancel build
Builds can be manually canceled using the following command:

----
osc cancel-build <buildID>
----

== Source Code
The source code location is one of the required parameters for the BuildConfig.
The build will use this location and fetch the source code that is later build.
The source code location definion is part of the 'parameters' section in
BuildConfig and it looks like this:

        {
          "source" : {
            "type" : "Git",
            "git" : {
              "uri": "git://github.com/openshift/ruby-hello-world.git"
            },
            "contextDir": "app/dir",
          },
        }

The 'type' field describe what SCM will be used to fetch your source code. In this
example, your source code lives in 'GIT' repository. Then the 'git' field
contains the 'uri' to your remote GIT repository. It might optionally specify
the 'ref' field if you want to checkout a specific GIT ref. A valid 'ref' might
be a SHA1 tag or a branch name.

The 'contextDir' field allows you to override the default location inside the
source code repository, where the build will look for the application source
code. If your application exists inside a sub-directory you can override the
default location (root folder) using this field.

== Build triggers
When defining a BuildConfig, you can define triggers to control circumstances under which a Build should be run for the BuildConfig.  There are 2 main types of triggers available:

* Webhook
* Image change

=== Webhook triggers
Webhook triggers allow you to trigger a new build by sending a request to the OpenShift API endpoint.  You can define two types of webhook triggers:

* https://developer.github.com/webhooks/[Github Webhooks]
* Generic Webhooks

==== Github webhooks
Github webhooks can handle the call made by Github when a repository is updated.  When defining the trigger you can specify a `secret` which will be a part of the URL you supply to Github when configuring the webhook.  This will ensure that only you and your repository can trigger the build.  The trigger definition json within the BuildConfig looks like this:

        {
          "type": "github",
          "github": {
            "secret": "secret101"
          }
        }

Instructions for creating a Github Webhook are https://developer.github.com/webhooks/creating/[here].  The payload URL is the URL returned as the Github Webhook URL by the `describe` command (see below).  It will be of the form `http://<openshift_api_host:port>/osapi/v1beta1/buildConfigHooks/<build-name>/<secret>/github?namespace=<namespace>`

==== Generic webhooks
Generic webhooks can be invoked from any system capable of making a web request.  As with a Github webhook, you specify a secret when defining the trigger and the caller must provide this secret to trigger the build.  The trigger definition json within the BuildConfig looks like this:

        {
          "type": "generic",
          "generic": {
            "secret": "secret101"
          }
        }

To setup the caller, supply the calling system with the URL of the generic webhook endpoint for your build which will look like `http://<openshift_api_host:port>/osapi/v1beta/buildConfigHooks/<build-name>/<secret>/generic?namespace=<namespace>`

The endpoint can accept an optional payload with the following format:

----
{
     type: 'git',
     git: {
        uri: '<url to git repository>',
	ref: '<optional git reference>',
	commit: '<commit hash identifying a specific git commit>',
	author: {
		name: '<author name>',
		email: '<author e-mail>',
	},
	committer: {
		name: '<committer name>',
		email: '<committer e-mail>',
	},
	message: '<commit message>'
     }
}
----

==== Displaying a build configuration's Webhook URLs

Use the `openshift cli describe buildConfig [replaceable]#<name>#` command to display the Webhook URLs associated with a build configuration. If no Webhook URLs are displayed, it means that no Webhook trigger is defined for that build configuration.

=== Image change triggers
Image change triggers allow your build to be automatically invoked when a new version of an upstream image is available. For example, if a build is based on top of a RHEL image, then you can trigger that build to run anytime the RHEL image changes. As a result, the application image is always running on the latest RHEL base image.

Configuring an image change trigger requires a few pieces be in place. Firstly, you must define an ImageRepository that points to the upstream image from which you want to trigger. An example of an ImageRepository definition is as follows:

    {
      "metadata":{
        "name": "ruby-20-centos",
      },
      "kind": "ImageRepository",
      "apiVersion": "v1beta1",
    }

This defines an image repository which is tied to a Docker image repository located at <system-registry>/<namespace>/ruby-20-centos. The system-registry is defined as a service with the name `docker-registry` running in OpenShift.

Next, define a build with a strategy which consumes some upstream image; for example:

    "strategy": {
      "type": "STI",
      "stiStrategy": {
        "image": "172.30.17.3:5001/mynamespace/ruby-20-centos",
      }
    }

In this case the STI strategy definition is consuming a Docker image repository named 172.30.17.3:5001/mynamespace/ruby-20-centos. Here, 172.30.17.3:5001 corresponds to the OpenShift system registry service.

Finally, define an image change trigger to tie these pieces together:

    {
      "type": "imageChange",
       "imageChange": {
        "image": "172.30.17.3:5001/mynamespace/ruby-20-centos",
        "from": {
          "name": "ruby-20-centos"
        },
        "tag":"latest"
      }
    }

This defines an image change trigger which monitors the `ruby-20-centos` ImageRepository defined earlier.  Specifically, it monitors for changes to the `latest` tag in that repository.  When a change occurs, a new build is triggered and will be supplied with an immutable Docker tag which points to the new image that was just created.  Wherever the BuildConfig previously referenced `172.30.17.3:5001/mynamespace/ruby-20-centos` (as defined by the image change trigger's image field) the value will be replaced with the new immutable image tag; for example, the newly-created build will have a definition like:

    "strategy": {
      "type": "STI",
      "stiStrategy": {
        "image": "172.30.17.3:5001/mynamespace/ruby-20-centos:immutableid",
      }
    }

This ensures that the triggered build uses the new image that was just pushed to the repository, and the build can be rerun anytime with exactly the same inputs.

For STI type builds, the field that is matched and replaced is the `stiStrategy.image` field.  For Docker type builds, the field is `dockerStrategy.baseImage`.  For Custom builds, the `customStrategy.image` field will be updated.  In addition, for Custom builds, the `OPENSHIFT_CUSTOM_BUILD_BASE_IMAGE` environment variable will be checked.  If it does not exist, it will be created with the immutable image reference.  If it does exist and the value matches the image field of the image change trigger, it will be updated with the immutable image reference.

In addition, anytime an ImageChange trigger is defined on a BuildConfig and a build is triggered (whether due to an image change, webhook trigger, or manual request), the build that is created will use the immutableid resolved from the ImageRepository pointed to by the ImageChange trigger.  This ensures that builds are performed using consistent image tags for reproduceability.
