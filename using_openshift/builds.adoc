== Overview

A link:../architecture/builds.html[build] is a process of creating runnable
images to be used on OpenShift. There are three types of builds:

* Docker build
* STI build
* custom build

== Starting a Build
You can manually invoke a build using the following command:

****
`$ osc start-build _<buildConfigID>_`
****

A build can be re-run using the `--from-build` flag:

****
`$ osc start-build --from-build=_<buildID>_`
****

Specify the `--follow` flag to stream the build's logs in stdout:

****
`$ osc start-build _<buildConfigID>_ --follow`
****

== Canceling a Build
You can manually cancel a build using the following command:

****
`$ osc cancel-build _<buildID>_`
****

== Accessing Build Logs
To allow access to build logs, use the following command:

****
`$ osc build-logs _<buildID>_`
****

== Source Code
The source code location is one of the required parameters for the BuildConfig.
The build uses this location and fetches the source code that is later built.
The source code location definition is part of the *`parameters`* section in the
BuildConfig:

====

----
        {
          "source" : {
            "type" : "Git", <1>
            "git" : { <2>
              "uri": "git://github.com/openshift/ruby-hello-world.git"
            },
            "contextDir": "app/dir", <3>
          },
        }
----

<1> The `type` field describes what SCM is used to fetch your source code.
<2> In this example, the `git` field contains the URI to the remote Git
repository where your source code lives. It might optionally specify the `ref`
field if you want to check out a specific Git reference. A valid `ref` can be a
SHA1 tag or a branch name.
<3> The `contextDir` field allows you to override the default location inside
the source code repository, where the build looks for the application source
code. If your application exists inside a sub-directory, you can override the
default location (the root folder) using this field.

[[using-the-sti-environment-file]]
== STI Environment File

link:../image_writers_guide/sti.html[STI] enables you to set environment values
in your application by specifying them in a *_.sti/environment_* file in the
source repository. The environment variables are then present during the build
process and in the final docker image. The complete list of supported
environment variables are available in the documentation for each image.

If you provide a *_.sti/environment_* file in your source repository, STI reads
this file during the build. This allows customization of the build behavior as
the *_assemble_* script may use these variables.

For example, if you want to disable assets compilation for your Rails
application, you can add `*DISABLE_ASSET_COMPILATION=true*` in the
*_.sti/environment_* file to cause assets compilation to be skipped during the
build.

In addition to builds, the specified environment variables are also available in
the running application itself. For example, you can add
`*RAILS_ENV=development*` in the *_.sti/environment_* file to cause the Rails
application to be started in `development` mode instead of `production`.

== Build Triggers
When defining a BuildConfig, you can define triggers to control the
circumstances in which a build should be run for the BuildConfig. There are two
types of triggers available:

* Webhook
* Image change

=== Webhook Triggers
Webhook triggers allow you to trigger a new build by sending a request to the
OpenShift API endpoint. You can define these triggers using
https://developer.github.com/webhooks/[GitHub webhooks] or generic webhooks.

*GitHub Webhooks*

https://developer.github.com/webhooks/creating/[GitHub webhooks] can handle the
call made by GitHub when a repository is updated. When defining the trigger, you
can specify a *secret* as part of the URL you supply to GitHub when
configuring the webhook. The *secret* ensures that only you and your
repository can trigger the build. The following example is a trigger definition
JSON within the BuildConfig:

====

----
        {
          "type": "github",
          "github": {
            "secret": "secret101"
          }
        }
----
====

The payload URL is returned as the GitHub Webhook URL by the `describe` command
(see link:#describe-buildconfig[below]), and is structured as follows:

****
`http://_<openshift_api_host:port>_/osapi/v1beta1/buildConfigHooks/_<build-name>_/_<secret>_/github?namespace=_<namespace>_`
****

*Generic Webhooks*

Generic webhooks can be invoked from any system capable of making a web
request. As with a GitHub webhook, you specify a *secret* when defining the
trigger, and the caller must provide this *secret* to trigger the build. The
following is an example trigger definition JSON within the BuildConfig:

====

----
        {
          "type": "generic",
          "generic": {
            "secret": "secret101"
          }
        }
----
====

To set up the caller, supply the calling system with the URL of the generic
webhook endpoint for your build:

****
`http://_<openshift_api_host:port>_/osapi/v1beta/buildConfigHooks/_<build-name>_/_<secret>_/generic?namespace=_<namespace>_`
****

The endpoint can accept an optional payload with the following format:

----
{
     type: 'git',
     git: {
        uri: '<url to git repository>',
	ref: '<optional git reference>',
	commit: '<commit hash identifying a specific git commit>',
	author: {
		name: '<author name>',
		email: '<author e-mail>',
	},
	committer: {
		name: '<committer name>',
		email: '<committer e-mail>',
	},
	message: '<commit message>'
     }
}
----

[#describe-buildconfig]
*Displaying a BuildConfig's Webhook URLs*

Use the following command to display the Webhook URLs associated with a build
configuration:

****
`osc describe buildConfig _<name>_`
****

If the above command does not display any Webhook URLs, then no Webhook trigger
is defined for that build configuration.

=== Image Change Triggers
Image change triggers allow your build to be automatically invoked when a new
version of an upstream image is available. For example, if a build is based on
top of a RHEL image, then you can trigger that build to run anytime the RHEL
image changes. As a result, the application image is always running on the
latest RHEL base image.

Configuring an image change trigger requires the following actions:

1. Define an ImageRepository that points to the upstream image you want to
trigger:
+
====

----
    {
      "metadata":{
        "name": "ruby-20-centos7",
      },
      "kind": "ImageRepository",
      "apiVersion": "v1beta1",
    }
----
====
+
This defines the image repository that is tied to a Docker image repository
located at `_<system-registry>_/_<namespace>_/ruby-20-centos7`. The
`_<system-registry>_` is defined as a service with the name `docker-registry`
running in OpenShift.

2. Define a build with a strategy that consumes some upstream image; for
example:
+
====

----
    "strategy": {
      "type": "STI",
      "stiStrategy": {
        "image": "172.30.17.3:5001/mynamespace/ruby-20-centos7",
      }
    }
----
====
+
In this case, the STI strategy definition is consuming a Docker image repository
named `172.30.17.3:5001/mynamespace/ruby-20-centos7`. Here, `172.30.17.3:5001`
corresponds to the OpenShift system registry service.

3. Define an image change trigger to tie these pieces together:
+
====

----
    {
      "type": "imageChange",
       "imageChange": {
        "image": "172.30.17.3:5001/mynamespace/ruby-20-centos7",
        "from": {
          "name": "ruby-20-centos7"
        },
        "tag":"latest"
      }
    }
----
====
+
This defines an image change trigger which monitors the `ruby-20-centos7`
ImageRepository defined earlier. Specifically, it monitors for changes to the
`latest` tag in that repository. When a change occurs, a new build is triggered
and is supplied with an immutable Docker tag that points to the new image that
was just created. Wherever the BuildConfig previously referenced
`172.30.17.3:5001/mynamespace/ruby-20-centos7` (as defined by the image change
trigger's image field), the value is replaced with the new immutable image tag;
for example, the newly-created build's definition:
+
====

----
    "strategy": {
      "type": "STI",
      "stiStrategy": {
        "image": "172.30.17.3:5001/mynamespace/ruby-20-centos7:immutableid",
      }
    }
----
====
+
This ensures that the triggered build uses the new image that was just pushed to
the repository, and the build can be re-run anytime with exactly the same
inputs.

For link:../openshift_sti_images/overview.html[STI type builds], the field that
is matched and replaced is the `stiStrategy.image` field. For Docker builds, the
field is `dockerStrategy.baseImage`. For Custom builds, the
`customStrategy.image` field is updated.

In addition, for custom builds, the `OPENSHIFT_CUSTOM_BUILD_BASE_IMAGE`
environment variable is checked. If it does not exist, then it is created with
the immutable image reference. If it does exist and the value matches the image
field of the image change trigger, then it is updated with the immutable image
reference.

If an ImageChange trigger is defined on a BuildConfig and a build is
triggered (due to an image change, webhook trigger, or manual request),
then the build that is created uses the *immutableid* resolved from the
ImageRepository pointed to by the ImageChange trigger. This ensures that builds
are performed using consistent image tags for ease of reproduction.
