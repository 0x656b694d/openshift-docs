== Overview
A build is a process of creating runnable image to be used inside OpenShift.
We defined three types of builds:

* docker build
* STI build
* custom build.

More of this is described link:../architecture/builds.html[here].

== Build logs
Builds allow access to their logs using following command:

----
osc build-logs <buildID>
----

== Start build
Build can be manually invoked using following command:

----
osc start-build <buildConfigID>
----

Build can also be re-run using `--from-build` flag:

----
osc start-build --from-build=<buildID>
----

== Cancel build
Build can be manually canceled using following command:

----
osc cancel-build <buildID>
----

== Build triggers
When defining a BuildConfig, you can define triggers to control circumstances under which a Build should be run for the BuildConfig.  There are 2 main types of triggers available:

* Webhook
* Image change

=== Webhook triggers
Webhook triggers allow you to trigger a new build by sending a request to the OpenShift API endpoint.  You can define two types of webhook triggers:  

* https://developer.github.com/webhooks/[Github Webhooks]
* Generic Webhooks

==== Github webhooks
Github webhooks can handle the call made by Github when a repository is updated.  When defining the trigger you can specify a `secret` which will be a part of the URL you supply to Github when configuring the webhook.  This will ensure that only you and your repository can trigger the build.  The trigger definition json within the BuildConfig looks like this:

        {
          "type": "github",
          "github": {
            "secret": "secret101"
          }
        }

Instructions for creating a Github Webhook are https://developer.github.com/webhooks/creating/[here].  The payload URL is the URL returned as the Github Webhook URL by the `describe` command (see below).  It will be of the form `http://<openshift_api_host:port>/osapi/v1beta1/buildConfigHooks/<build-name>/<secret>/github?namespace=<namespace>`

==== Generic webhooks
Generic webhooks can be invoked from any system capable of making a web request.  As with a Github webhook, you specify a secret when defining the trigger and the caller must provide this secret to trigger the build.  The trigger definition json within the BuildConfig looks like this:

        {
          "type": "generic",
          "generic": {
            "secret": "secret101"
          }
        }

To setup the caller, supply the calling system with the URL of the generic webhook endpoint for your build which will look like `http://<openshift_api_host:port>/osapi/v1beta/buildConfigHooks/<build-name>/<secret>/generic?namespace=<namespace>`

The endpoint can accept an optional payload with the following format:

----
{
     type: 'git',
     git: {
        uri: '<url to git repository>',
	ref: '<optional git reference>',
	commit: '<commit hash identifying a specific git commit>',
	author: {
		name: '<author name>',
		email: '<author e-mail>',
	},
	committer: {
		name: '<committer name>',
		email: '<committer e-mail>',
	},
	message: '<commit message>'
     }
}
----

==== Displaying a build configuration's Webhook URLs

Use the `openshift cli describe buildConfig [replaceable]#<name>#` command to display the Webhook URLs associated with a build configuration. If no Webhook URLs are displayed, it means that no Webhook trigger is defined for that build configuration.

=== Image change triggers
Image change triggers allow your build to be automatically invoked when a new version of an upstream image is available.  For example if your build is based on top of a RHEL image, you can trigger your build to run any time the RHEL image changes so that your application image is always running on the latest RHEL base image.

Configuring an image change trigger requires a few pieces be in place.  First of all you must define an ImageRepository which points to the upstream image you want to trigger off of.  An example of an ImageRepository definition is as follows:

    {
      "metadata":{
        "name": "ruby-20-centos",
      },
      "kind": "ImageRepository",
      "apiVersion": "v1beta1",
    }

Here we have defined an image repository which is tied to a Docker image repository located at <system-registry>/<namespace>/ruby-20-centos.  The system-registry is defined as a service with the name `docker-registry` running in OpenShift.

Next we need to define a build with a strategy which consumes some upstream image, for example:

    "strategy": {
      "type": "STI",
      "stiStrategy": {
        "image": "172.30.17.3:5001/mynamespace/ruby-20-centos",            
      }
    }

In this case the STI strategy definition is consuming a Docker image repository named 172.30.17.3:5001/mynamespace/ruby-20-centos.  Here, 172.30.17.3:5001 corresponds to the OpenShift system registry service.

Finally, we define an image change trigger to tie these pieces together:

    {
      "type": "imageChange",
       "imageChange": {
        "image": "172.30.17.3:5001/mynamespace/ruby-20-centos",
        "from": {
          "name": "ruby-20-centos"
        },
        "tag":"latest"
      }
    }

Here we have defined an image change trigger which monitors the `ruby-20-centos` ImageRepository defined earlier.  Specifically we monitor for changes to the `latest` tag in that repository.  When a change occurs, a new build will be trigger and build will be supplied with an immutable Docker tag which points to exactly the new image that was just created.  Where ever the BuildConfig previously referenced `172.30.17.3:5001/mynamespace/ruby-20-centos` (as defined by the image change trigger's image field) the value will be replaced with the new immutable image tag, so for example the Build that is created will have a definition like:

    "strategy": {
      "type": "STI",
      "stiStrategy": {
        "image": "172.30.17.3:5001/mynamespace/ruby-20-centos:immutableid",            
      }
    }

This will ensure that the triggered build uses exactly the new image that was just pushed to the repository, and the build can be rerun at will with exactly the same inputs.
