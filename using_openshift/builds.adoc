== Overview
A build is a process of creating runnable image to be used inside OpenShift.
We defined three types of builds:
* docker build
* STI build
* custom build.
More of this is described in link:../architecture/builds[here].

== Build logs
Builds allow access to their logs using following command:

----
osc build-logs <buildID>
----

== Start build
Build can be manually invoked using following command:

----
osc start-build <buildConfigID|buildID>
----

== Cancel build
Build can be manually canceled using following command:

----
osc cancel-build <buildID>
----
