== Overview
With the OpenShift command line interface (CLI), you can create and manage OpenShift projects from a terminal. The CLI is ideal in situations where you are:

* Working directly with project source code
* Scripting OpenShift operations
* Restricted by bandwidth resources and cannot use the web console

The CLI commands are available directly from the OpenShift binary with the following syntax:

****
`openshift cli [replaceable]#<command>#`
****

However, if `osc` is available on your workstation you can use it as a shortcut in place of `openshift cli` in the command syntax:

****
`osc [replaceable]#<command>#`
****

NOTE: Although `osc` is used in the command examples presented throughout this document, you can substitute `openshift cli` in the command syntax if `osc` is not available on your workstation.

== Setup and Login
The recommended way to setup the OpenShift CLI is using the `osc login` command. This command can be considered *the entry-point for every first-time OpenShift CLI user*. It features an *interactive flow* that will guide the user through establishing a session against an OpenShift server with the provided credentials, and will *automatically save* a config file that will be used by every subsequent command. 

Here is an example of how an `osc login` run looks like:

----
$ osc login
Please provide the server URL or just <enter> to use 'https://my-openshift-server.com': 
Authenticate for "openshift"
Username: myuser
Password: ******
Logged into 'https://my-openshift-server.com' as 'myuser'.
Using project 'project01'.
Welcome to OpenShift v3! Use 'osc --help' for a list of commands available.
----

Three major things happened in the above command run:

* `osc login` asked for the OpenShift server URL and the user's credentials (_username_ and _password_), established a session in the server, and received a session token.
* One OpenShift project the user has access to was selected and set as default.
* All information gathered were saved in a config file located in `~/.config/openshift/.config`.

Here's how the content of the config file just created in `~/.config/openshift/.config` looks like:

----
apiVersion: v1
clusters:
- cluster:
    server: https://my-openshift-server.com
  name: myserver
contexts:
- context:
    cluster: myserver
    namespace: project01
    user: myuser
  name: mycontext
current-context: mycontext
kind: Config
preferences: {}
users:
- name: myuser
  user:
    token: NmUyM2M4YjQtZDc2ZC00MDFiLWIxZGEtMjY4N2RlZmJlODE2
---- 

From now on, every subsequent command will make use of the server, session token and project referenced in that config file. Notice what happens if you run `osc login` again:

----
$ osc login
Already logged into 'https://my-openshift-server.com' as 'myuser'.
Using project 'project01'.
----

== Configuration Files

Configuration file permanently stores `osc` options; it contains a series of authentication mechanisms and server connection information associated with nicknames. As described in the previous section, the `osc login` command is capable of creating and managing configuration files automatically.

.Sample configuration file:
====

----
apiVersion: v1
clusters:
- cluster:
    server: http://localhost:8080
  name: my-server
contexts:
- context:
    cluster: my-server
    namespace: my-namespace
    user: my-user
  name: default-context
current-context: default-context
kind: Config
preferences: {}
users:
- name: my-user
  user:
    auth-path: path/to/my/existing/auth-file
----
====

Configuration files can be used for example to configure OpenShift to support the setup of multiple servers, namespaces, and users so that you can switch easily between them. Multiple configuration files are allowed; they are loaded at runtime and merged together along with override options specified from the command line. 

There are a few ways to provide `osc` a configuration file. Basically when loading configurations the following priority rules for configuration file loading are observed (in this exact order):

.  The path provided by the `--config` command line option
.  The path provided by the `$OPENSHIFTCONFIG` environment variable
.  The `.openshiftconfig` file in the current directory
.  The `.config` file inside the `.config/openshift` directory in the user's home: `~/.config/openshift/.config`
.  The path provided by the `$KUBECONFIG` environment variable
.  The `.kubeconfig` file in the current directory
.  The `.kubeconfig` file inside the `.kube` directory in the user's home: `~/.kube/.kubeconfig`

For details about advanced management of config files, see link:../using_openshift/managing_cli_profiles.html[Managing CLI Profiles].

== Projects

A link:../architecture/openshift_model.html#project-experimental[project] in OpenShift terms is the package that can contain multiple link:../architecture/openshift_model.html[components] that will compose your logical "link:../v2_changes/applications.html[application]". 

That said, most `osc` commands that will be described in the sections below run in the context of a _project_. When running `osc login` a project will be set as default to be used by every subsequent command, and if the user has access to more than one project, one of them will be picked:

----
$ osc login --server=https://localhost:8443 --certificate-authority=cert.crt
Authenticate for "openshift"
Username: myuser
Password: ******
Logged into 'https://localhost:8443' as 'myuser'.
Your projects are: project01, project02, project03. You can switch between them at any time using 'osc project <project-name>'.
Using project 'project01'.
Welcome to OpenShift v3! Use 'osc --help' for a list of commands available.
----

To switch between the projects an user has access to, the `osc project` command is provided. It can be used as `osc project <project-name>` to switch to an explicit project, or just as `osc project` to display the project currently in use.

----
$ osc project project02
Now using project 'project02'.

$ osc project project03
Now using project 'project03'.

$ osc project
Using project 'project03'.
----

The same way `git status` provides a general overview of the working tree of a local git repository, we provide a command that shows a high level overview of the project currently in use, with its components and their relationships. This command takes no argument. Sample output of the `osc status` command:

----
$ osc status
In project OpenShift 3 Sample (test)

service database-test (172.30.17.113:6434 -> 3306)
  database-test deploys docker.io/library/mysql:latest
    #1 deployed 47 hours ago

service frontend-test (172.30.17.236:5432 -> 8080)
  frontend-test deploys origin-ruby-sample:test <-
    builds git://github.com/openshift/ruby-hello-world.git with docker.io/openshift/ruby-20-centos7:latest
    not built yet
    #1 deployment waiting on image

To see more information about a service or deployment config, use 'osc describe service <name>' or 'osc describe dc <name>'.
You can use 'osc get pods,svc,dc,bc,builds' to see lists of each of the types described above. 
----

== CLI Object Types
OpenShift supports the following object types, some of which have abbreviated syntax that you can use with `osc`.

.Supported Object Types
[options="header"]
|===

|Object Type |Abbreviated Version

|build |
|buildConfig | `bc`
|deploymentConfig | `dc`
|imageStream | `is`
|imageStreamTag | `istag`
|imageStreamImage | `isimage`
|event |`ev`
|minion |`mi`
|pod |`po`
|replicationController |`rc`
|service |`svc`
|===

== Common CLI Operations
The CLI allows interaction with the various objects that are managed by OpenShift. The common `osc` operations are invoked by specifying the following:

* An _action_
* The _object type_ to perform the action on
* The _object name_ or _ID_ of the specified _object type_

In the following example the `osc get` operation returns a complete list of services that are currently defined.

----
$ osc get se
NAME                LABELS                                    SELECTOR            IP                  PORT
kubernetes          component=apiserver,provider=kubernetes   <none>              172.30.17.96        443
kubernetes-ro       component=apiserver,provider=kubernetes   <none>              172.30.17.77        80
docker-registry     <none>                                    name=registrypod    172.30.17.158       5001
----

The following example operation returns the same list that is filtered down to an individual object:

----
$ osc get se kubernetes-ro
NAME                LABELS                                    SELECTOR            IP                  PORT
kubernetes-ro       component=apiserver,provider=kubernetes   <none>              172.30.17.77        80
----

The following table describes the common `osc` operations and their general syntax.

.Common CLI Operations
[cols=".^2,.^5,8",options="header"]
|===

|Operation |Syntax |Description

|`get`
|`osc get [replaceable]#<object_type># _<object_id>_`
|Returns a list of objects for the specified link:#cli-object-types[object type]. If the optional _object name_ or _ID_ is included in the request, then the list of results is filtered by that value.

|`describe`
|`osc describe _<object_type>_ _<object_id>_`
|Returns information about the specific object returned by the query; a specific _object name_ or _ID_ must be provided. The actual information that is available varies as described in link:#cli-object-types[object type].

|`create`
|`osc create -f _<file_or_directory_path>_`
|Parses a configuration file and creates one or more OpenShift objects based on the file contents. The -f flag can be passed multiple times with different file or directory paths. When the flag is passed multiple times, `osc create` iterates through each one, creating the objects described in all of the indicated files. Any existing resources are ignored.

|`describe`
|`osc describe _<object_type>_ _<object_id>_`
|Returns information about the specific object returned by the query; a specific _object name_ or _ID_ must be provided. The actual information that is available varies as described in link:#object-types[object type].

|`create`
|`osc create -f _<file_path>_`
|Parses a configuration file and creates one or more OpenShift objects based on the file contents.

|`update`
|`osc update -f _<file_or_directory_path>_`
|Attempts to modify an existing object based on the contents of the specified configuration file. The -f flag can be passed multiple times with different file or directory paths. When the flag is passed multiple times, `osc update` iterates through each one, updating the objects described in all of the indicated files.

|`delete`
a|`osc delete -f _<file_path>_`

`osc delete _<object_type>_ _<object_id>_`

`osc delete _<object_type>_ -l _<label>_`
.^|Deletes the specified OpenShift object. An object configuration can also be passed in through STDIN.

|`log`
|`osc log -f _<pod_name>_ _<container_name>_`
|Retrieves the log output for a specific pod or container. This command does not work for other object types.
|===

== Project CLI Operations
These advanced operations are used to define and instantiate OpenShift objects at the project level.

The simplest way to create a new project is:
`openshift ex new-project _<project-name> --display-name=<display-name> --description=<description> --admin=<admin-username>`


For example: `openshift ex new-project test --display-name="OpenShift 3 Sample" --description="This is an example project to demonstrate OpenShift v3" --admin=anypassword:test-admin` creates a new project called `test` that appears in the web console as "Openshift 3 Sample", with `test-admin` as the project admin.

.Project CLI Operations
[cols=".^2,.^5,8",options="header"]
|===

|Operation |Syntax |Description

|`process`
|`osc process -f _<template_file_path>_`
|Transforms a project template into a project configuration file.

|`apply`
|`osc apply -f _<config_file_path>_`
|Creates all of the OpenShift objects for a given project based on the specified configuration file.
|===

== Build CLI Operations
One of the fundamental capabilities of OpenShift is the ability to build applications into a container from source. The following table describes the CLI operations for working with application builds.

.Build CLI Operations
[cols=".^2,.^5,8",options="header"]
|===

|Operation |Syntax |Description

|`start-build`
|`osc start-build _<buildConfig_name>_`
|Manually starts the build process with the specified build configuration file.

|`start-build`
|`osc start-build --from-build=_<build_name>_`
|Manually starts the build process by specifying the name of a previous build as a starting point.

|`start-build`
|`osc start-build [_<buildConfig_name>_ or --from-build=_<build_name>_] --follow`
|Manually starts the build process by specifying either the name of a previous build or a configuration file and retrieves its build logs.

|`cancel-build`
|`osc cancel-build _<build_name>_`
|Stops a build that is in progress.

|`build-logs`
|`osc build-logs _<build_name>_`
|Retrieves the build logs for the specified build.
|===

== Deployment CLI Operations
OpenShift provides CLI access to inspect and manipulate deployment configurations using standard `osc` resource operations such as `get`, `create`, and `describe`.

=== Deployment Configurations

The syntax to describe a deployment configuration in human-readable form is:

****
`osc deploymentConfigs describe [replaceable]#<deployment config>#`
****

=== Deployment Rollbacks

Rollbacks revert an application back to a previous deployment. Note that environment variables and volumes are included in rollbacks, so there are a variety of considerations to make when deciding whether a rollback is viable, such as:

* If security credentials have been recently updated, the previous deployment may not have the correct values.
* If the previous deployment used a custom strategy, which is no longer available or usable, the deployment may not be deployed correctly.

By default, only the pod and container configuration will be changed and scaling or trigger settings will be left as-is.

Using the `-d`, or `--dry-run` option prints a human-readable representation of the updated deployment configuration instead of executing the rollback. This is useful for inspecting a desired outcome before an actual rollback.

Use the `osc rollback` command to revert part of an application back to a previous deployment. The syntax for `rollback` is:

****
`osc rollback [replaceable]#<deployment># [replaceable]#[options]#`
****

.Rollback CLI Configuration Options
[cols="4,8",options="header"]
|===

|Option |Description

.^|`--change-triggers`
|Include the previous deployment's triggers in the rollback.

.^|`--change-strategy`
|Include the previous deployment's strategy in the rollback.

.^|`-d, --dry-run`
|Instead of performing the rollback, describe what the rollback will look like in human-readable form.

.^|`-o, --output`
|Instead of performing the rollback, print the updated deployment configuration in the specified format (json\|yaml\|template\|templatefile).

.^|`-t, --template`
|Template string or path to template file to use when -o=template or -o=templatefile.
|===

==== Rollback Examples

Perform a rollback:

****
`osc rollback deployment-1`
****

See what the rollback will look like without performing the rollback:

****
`osc rollback deployment-1 --dry-run`
****

Perform the rollback manually by piping the JSON of the new config back to `osc`:

****
`osc rollback deployment-1 --output=json | osc update deploymentConfigs deployment -f -`
****
