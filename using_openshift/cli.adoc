== Overview
The OpenShift CLI enables you to create and manage OpenShift projects from a terminal. This is useful for situations where:

* You are working directly with project source code
* You are scripting OpenShift operations
* You are bandwidth-constrained and can't use the web console

The CLI commands are available directly from the OpenShift binary by running `openshift cli <command>`, but if `osc` is available on your system, you can treat it as a shortcut to the same commands available through `openshift cli` (`osc <command>`).

NOTE: Throughout this document we will reference `osc`, but you can run the same commands with `openshift cli`.

== Configuring the CLI
Running `osc --help` reveals a large number of configuration options. These are well-documented, but some of the main ones you may need are:

*-s, --server* +
This enables you to specify the hostname of the OpenShift server. You will need to provide this if the server is running on a different host from the CLI.

*--insecure-skip-tls-verify=true* +
This is the quick and dirty way to interact with a server that is using HTTPS. Note, however, that it is not secure.

*--auth-path* +
*--certificate-authority* +
*--client-certificate* +
*--client-key* +
These settings are the _proper_ way to authenticate an OpenShift server that uses HTTPS. Connections set up this way will be secure.

[TIP]
====
*Can I just set these in a configuration file?* +
The ability to permanently set `osc` configuration details in a config file is forthcoming. For now you will need to pass these on the command line, or create a shell alias that sets the values that you need.

== Object Types in the CLI
The supported OpenShift object types are:

* build
* buildConfig
* event
* minion
* pod
* replicationController
* service

Some of these objects also have shorthand equivalent codes for use with `osc`:

* `po` - pods
* `rc` - replication controllers
* `se` - services
* `mi` - minions
* `ev` - events

== Common Operations
At its heart, the `osc` utility is just a mechanism for interacting with the various objects that OpenShift manages. The common `osc` commands are invoked by specifying an _action_, the _object type_ to perform the action on, and optionally a specific _object name or ID_ of the indicated object type.

For instance, running `osc get se` returns the complete list of currently defined services:

----
$ osc get se
NAME                LABELS                                    SELECTOR            IP                  PORT
kubernetes          component=apiserver,provider=kubernetes   <none>              172.30.17.96        443
kubernetes-ro       component=apiserver,provider=kubernetes   <none>              172.30.17.77        80
docker-registry     <none>                                    name=registrypod    172.30.17.158       5001
----

And running `osc get se kubernetes-ro` returns the same list filtered down to an individual object:

----
$ osc get se kubernetes-ro
NAME                LABELS                                    SELECTOR            IP                  PORT
kubernetes-ro       component=apiserver,provider=kubernetes   <none>              172.30.17.77        80

=== Get
*`osc get <object_type> _<object_id>_`* +
This command returns a list of objects of the indicated link:#object-types[object type]. If an object name or ID is optionally included in the request, the list of results will be filtered by that value.

=== Describe
*`osc describe <object_type> <object_id>`* +
This command returns information about the specific object returned by the query; a specific object name or ID must be provided. The exact information available varies per link:#object-types[object type].

=== Create / Create All
*`osc create -f <file_path>`* +
*`osc createall _-d <directory_path>_ _-f <file_path>_`* +
These commands perform the same central function, which is to parse a configuration file and create one or more OpenShift objects based on the file contents. In the `createall` case, you can specify a directory (`-d`) with multiple configuration files, a file (`-f`) that contains multiple configurations, or even pass configurations through STDIN.

=== Update
*`osc update -f <file_path>`* +
This command attempts to modify an existing object based on the contents of the specified configuration file. If the object does not already exist, this function behaves exactly like link:#create-create-all[`osc create`].

=== Delete
*`osc delete -f <file_path>`* +
*`osc delete <object_type> <object_id>`* +
*`osc delete <object_type> -l <label>`* +
This command deletes the identified OpenShift object. An object configuration can also be passed in via STDIN.

=== Log
*`osc log _-f_ <pod_name> _<container_name>_`* +
This command retrieves the log output for a specific pod / container. This command does not work for other object types.

== Project Operations
These advanced operations are used to define and instantiate OpenShift objects at the project level.

=== Process
*`osc process -f <template_file_path>`* +
This command transforms a project template into a project configuration file.

=== Apply
*`osc apply -f <config_file_path>`* +
This command creates all of the OpenShift objects for a given project based on the supplied 

== Build Operations
Being able to build your application into a container from source is a fundamental capability of the OpenShift system. These commands specifically enable you to work with builds.

=== Start Build
*`osc start-build <buildConfig_name>`* +
*`osc start-build --from-build=<build_name>`* +
This command enables you to manually trigger a build by specifying either a buildConfig or a previous build as the starting point.

=== Cancel Build
*`osc cancel-build <build_name>`* +
This command enables you to manually stop a build in progress.

=== Build Logs
*`osc build-logs <build_name>`* +
This command retrieves the log output for the specified build.
