== Overview

Many OpenShift applications use external resources (external databases, external SaaS endpoints,
etc).  These external resources are simple to model as native OpenShift services so that 
applications can work with them as they would any other internal service.

== Example: External SaaS Provider

One of the most common types of external services is an external SaaS endpoint.  As an example,
assume that you want to use a SaaS provider for which an application needs:

1. An endpoint to communicate with
2. A set of credentials:
   a.  An API key
   b.  A username
   c.  A passphrase

The formula for integrating with this type of external resource is fairly simple.  The pieces of
the solution are:

1.  A `Service` object to represent the SaaS provider as an OpenShift service
2.  One or more `Endpoints` for the service
3.  Environment variables in the appropriate pods that contain the credentials

=== Creating the service

The first step in integrating with an external service is to create an OpenShift service to
represent it.  This is very similar to creating an internal service; the difference is in the
service's `Selector` field.

Internal OpenShift services use the `Selector` field to associate pods with services
via labels.  A system component called `EndpointsController` synchronizes the endpoints for
services that specify selectors with the pods that match the selector.  The service proxy and
OpenShift router load-balance requests to the service amongst the service's endpoints.

The only difference between an internal OpenShift service and a service that represents an external
resource is that there are no pods to associate an external service with.  To represent external
services, we just need to leave the `Selector` field unset.  This will make the `EndpointsController`
ignore the service and allow you to specify endpoints manually:

----
{
  "kind": "Service",
  "apiVersion": "v1beta3",
  "metadata": {
    "name": "example-external-service"
  },
  "spec": { <1>
    "port": 1234
  }
}
----

<1> The service spec must have no `selector` field

=== Setting the endpoints

The next step is to create endpoints for the service.  This will give the service proxy and router
information about where to send traffic going to the service.

----
{
  "kind": "Endpoints",
  "apiVersion": "v1beta3",
  "metadata": {
    "name": "example-external-service" <1>
  },
  "endpoints": [ <2>
    "api.mysaas.com:80",
    "api2.mysaas.com:8080"
  ]
}
----

<1> The name must match the name of the `Service` instance
<2> Traffic to the service will be load-balanced between the supplied `Endpoints`

=== Consuming credentials in pods

Now that the service and endpoints are defined, we need to give pods the credentials to use the
service.  This is done by setting environment variables in the appropriate containers.  In this
example, the container will receive the following environment variables with credentials for the
service:

1.  `SAAS_API_KEY`: Holds the API key to use with the service
2.  `SAAS_USERNAME`: Holds the username to use with the service
3.  `SAAS_PASSPHRASE`: Holds the passphares to use with the service

                  {
                    "containerPort": 8080
                  }
                ],
                env: [
              	  {
              	    "name": "SAAS_API_KEY"
              	    "value": "<SaaS service API key>"
              	  },
              	  {
              	    "name": "SAAS_USERNAME"
              	    "value": "<SaaS service user>"
              	  },
              	  {
              	    "name": "SAAS_PASSPHRASE"
              	    "value": "<SaaS service passphrase>"
              	  },
                ]
              }
            ]
          }
        },
        "labels": {
          "name": "frontend"
        }
      }
    }
  },
}
----

<1> Other fields on the `DeploymentConfig` are omitted

=== Using the service in your application

Using an external service in your application is just like using an internal service.  Your
application will be injected with environment variables for the service and the additional
environment variables with the credentials described above.  In our example, The 'helloworld'
container will receive the following environment variables:

----
EXAMPLE_EXTERNAL_SERVICE_SERVICE_HOST=10.0.0.11 <1>
EXAMPLE_EXTERNAL_SERVICE_SERVICE_PORT=1234
SAAS_API_KEY=<value of SaaS api key>
SAAS_USERNAME=<value of SaaS username>
SAAS_PASSPHRASE=<value of SaaS passphrase>
----

<1> Example value only; actual IP will vary

The application is responsible for reading the coordinates and credentials for the service from the
environment and establishing a connection with the service.
