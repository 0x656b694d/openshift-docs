== Overview

Many OpenShift applications use external resources, such as external databases, or an external
SaaS endpoint. These external resources can be modeled as native OpenShift services, so that
applications can work with them as they would any other internal service.


== External MySQL Database

One of the most common types of external services is an external database. To support an external database, an application needs:

1. An endpoint to communicate with.
2. A set of credentials and coordinates. Including:
   a.  A username
   b.  A passphrase
   c.  A database name

The solution for integrating with an external database includes:

1.  A `Service` object to represent the SaaS provider as an OpenShift service
2.  One or more `Endpoints` for the service
3.  Environment variables in the appropriate pods containing the credentials

=== Creating the Service

The first step in integrating with an external service is to create an OpenShift service to
represent it. This is similar to creating an internal service; the difference is in the
service's `Selector` field.

Internal OpenShift services use the `Selector` field to associate pods with services
via labels. A system component called `EndpointsController` synchronizes the endpoints for
services that specify selectors with the pods that match the selector. The service proxy and
OpenShift router load-balance requests to the service amongst the service's endpoints.

The only difference between an internal OpenShift service and a service that represents an external
resource is that there are no pods to associate an external service with. To represent external
services, we just need to leave the `Selector` field unset. This will make the `EndpointsController`
ignore the service and allow you to specify endpoints manually:

====

----
{
  "kind": "Service",
  "apiVersion": "v1beta3",
  "metadata": {
    "name": "example-mysql-service"
  },
  "spec": { <1>
    "port": 3306
  }
}
----

<1> The `selector` field to leave blank.

====

=== Setting the Endpoints

The next step is to create endpoints for the service. This gives the service proxy and router
the location to send traffic going to the service.

====

----
{
  "kind": "Endpoints",
  "apiVersion": "v1beta3",
  "metadata": {
    "name": "external-mysql-service" <1>
  },
  "endpoints": [ <2>
    "my-instance.external-mysql.com:3306"
  ]
}
----

<1> The name of the `Service` instance.
<2> Traffic to the service will be load-balanced between the supplied `Endpoints` if more than one
    is supplied.

====

=== Consuming Credentials in Pods

Now that the service and endpoints are defined, we need to give pods the credentials to use the
service by setting environment variables in the appropriate containers. In the following
example, the container receives the following environment variables with credentials for the
service:

*  `MYSQL_USERNAME`: The username to use with the service.
*  `MYSQL_PASSPHRASE`: The passphrase to use with the service.
*  `MYSQL_DATABASE_NAME`: The database name.

                  {
                    "name": "SAAS_USERNAME"
                    "value": "<MySQL username>"
                  },
                  {
                    "name": "SAAS_PASSPHRASE"
                    "value": "<MySQL passphrase>"
                  },
                  {
                    "name": "MYSQL_DATABASE_NAME"
                    "value": "<MySQL database name>"
                  },
                ]
              }
            ]
          }
        },
        "labels": {
          "name": "frontend"
        }
      }
    }

=== External Database Environment Variables

Using an external service in your application is just like using an internal service. Your
application will be injected with environment variables for the service and the additional
environment variables with the credentials described above. In our example, The 'helloworld'
container will receive the following environment variables:

* `EXTERNAL_MYSQL_SERVICE_SERVICE_HOST`=[replaceable]#<IP_Address>#
* `EXTERNAL_MYSQL_SERVICE_SERVICE_PORT`=[replaceable]#<Port_Number>#
* `MYSQL_USERNAME`=[replaceable]#<MySQL_username>#
* `MYSQL_PASSPHRASE`=[replaceable]#<MySQL_passphrase>#
* `MYSQL_DATABASE_NAME`=[replaceable]#<MySQL_database>#

The application is responsible for reading the coordinates and credentials for the service from the
environment and establishing a connection with the database via the service.


== External SaaS Provider

One of the most common types of external services is an external SaaS endpoint. To support an external SaaS provider, an application needs:

1. An endpoint to communicate with
2. A set of credentials, such as:
   a.  An API key
   b.  A username
   c.  A passphrase

////
The formula for integrating with this type of external resource is fairly simple. The pieces of the
solution are:

1.  A `Service` object to represent the SaaS provider as an OpenShift service
2.  One or more `Endpoints` for the service
3.  Environment variables in the appropriate pods that contain the credentials
////

The following sections outline a scenario for intergrating with an external SaaS provider:

=== Create the Service

The first step in integrating with an external service is to create an OpenShift service to represent
it. This is similar to creating an internal service; however the difference is in the service's `Selector` field.

Internal OpenShift services use the `Selector` field to associate pods with services using labels. A
system component called `EndpointsController` synchronizes the endpoints for services that specify selectors
with the pods that match the selector. The service proxy and OpenShift router load-balance requests to the service
amongst the service's endpoints.

The only difference between an internal OpenShift service and a service that represents an external resource
is that there are no pods to associate an external service with. To represent external services, leave the `Selector`
field unset. This makes the `EndpointsController` ignore the service and allows you to specify endpoints manually:

====

----
{
  "kind": "Service",
  "apiVersion": "v1beta3",
  "metadata": {
    "name": "example-external-service"
  },
  "spec": { <1>
    "port": 1234
  }
}
----

<1> The `selector` field to leave blank.

====

=== Setting the Endpoints

The next step is to create endpoints for the service. This gives information about where to send traffic going to the
service to the service proxy and router.

====

----
{
  "kind": "Endpoints",
  "apiVersion": "v1beta3",
  "metadata": {
    "name": "example-external-service" <1>
  },
  "endpoints": [ <2>
    "api.mysaas.com:80",
    "api2.mysaas.com:8080"
  ]
}
----

====

<1> The name of the `Service` instance.
<2> Traffic to the service is load-balanced between the `Endpoints` supplied here.

=== Consuming Credentials in Pods

Now that the service and endpoints are defined, give pods the credentials to use the service. This is done
by setting environment variables in the appropriate containers. 

====

----
{
  "kind": "DeploymentConfig",
  "apiVersion": "v1beta1",
  "metadata": {
    "name": "my-app-deployment"
  },
  "template": { <1>
    "controllerTemplate": {
      "replicas": 1,
      "replicaSelector": {
        "name": "frontend"
      },
      "podTemplate": {
        "desiredState": {
          "manifest": {
            "version": "v1beta1",
            "containers": [
              {
                "name": "helloworld",
                "image": "openshift/openshift/origin-ruby-sample",
                "ports": [
                  {
                    "containerPort": 8080
                  }
                ],
                env: [
              	  {
              	    "name": "SAAS_API_KEY" <2>
              	    "value": "<SaaS service API key>"
              	  },
              	  {
              	    "name": "SAAS_USERNAME" <3>
              	    "value": "<SaaS service user>"
              	  },
              	  {
              	    "name": "SAAS_PASSPHRASE" <4>
              	    "value": "<SaaS service passphrase>"
              	  },
                ]
              }
            ]
          }
        },
        "labels": {
          "name": "frontend"
        }
      }
    }
  },
}
----

<1> Other fields on the `DeploymentConfig` are omitted.
<2> `SAAS_API_KEY`: The API key to use with the service.
<3> `SAAS_USERNAME`: The username to use with the service.
<4> `SAAS_PASSPHRASE`: The passphrase to use with the service.

=== External SaaS Provider Environment Variables

Using an external service in your application is just like using an internal service. Your application is
injected with environment variables for the service and the additional environment variables with the credentials
described above. In the following example, the 'helloworld' container receives the following environment variables:


* `EXAMPLE_EXTERNAL_SERVICE_SERVICE_HOST`=[replaceable]#<IP_Address>#
* `EXAMPLE_EXTERNAL_SERVICE_SERVICE_PORT`=[replaceable]#<Port_Number>#
* `SAAS_API_KEY`=[replaceable]#<value of SaaS api key>#
* `SAAS_USERNAME`=[replaceable]#<value of SaaS username>#
* `SAAS_PASSPHRASE`=[replaceable]#<value of SaaS passphrase>#

The application is responsible for reading the coordinates and credentials for the service from the environment
and establishing a connection with the service.
