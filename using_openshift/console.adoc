== Overview
With the OpenShift management console you can visualize and browse the contents of your projects.

NOTE: JavaScript must be enabled to use the management console.  For the best experience use a web browser that supports link:http://caniuse.com/#feat=websockets[websockets].

=== Navigating
The management console's navigation structure is focused around projects. The project selector allows you to switch between projects you have access to.

The main navigation within a project consist of:

Overview:: Visualize the contents of your project and get a high-level view of what is happening.
Browse:: Dig into the different resource types within your project.

=== Filtering by labels
Every view within a project has the ability to filter the contents of the page by labels on the resources.  Pick from suggested label names and values or type in your own. Multiple filters can be added. When multiple filters are applied, resources must match all of the filters to remain visible.

Start by selecting a label name.

Next select between:

* exists - only check that the label name exists but do not care what it's value is
* in - check that the label name exists and is equal to one of the values that will be chosen
* not in - check that the label name either does not exist or is not equal to any of the values that will be chosen

If you selected 'in' or 'not in' then choose a set of values and then select 'Filter'

Once filters have been added, if you want to stop filtering you can either 'Clear all filters' or click on individual filters to remove them.
