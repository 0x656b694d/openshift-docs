== Overview
With the OpenShift Management Console, you can visualize and browse the contents of your projects.

NOTE: JavaScript must be enabled to use the Management Console. For the best experience, use a web browser that supports link:http://caniuse.com/#feat=websockets[websockets].

=== Navigating
The Management Console's navigation structure is focused around projects. The project selector allows you to switch between projects you have access to:

image:../../_images/console_navigation.png["Console Navigation",link="../../_images/console_navigation.png"]

use the left tabs to navigate within a project:

Overview:: Visualize the contents of your project with a high-level view of each feature.
Browse:: Explore the different resource types within your project.
Settings:: General information about your project, as well as the  link:../architecture/kubernetes_model.html#resourcequota[quota] and link:../architecture/kubernetes_model.html#limitrange[resource limits] that are set on your project.

=== Filtering by labels
Filter the contents of a project page by using the labels of a resource. You can pick from a suggested label name and values, or type in your own. Multiple filters can be added. When multiple filters are applied, resources must match all of the filters to remain visible. To filter by labels:

1. Select a label type:
+

2. Select one of the following:
* *exists* - verify that the label name exists, but ignore its value.
* *in* - verify that the label name exists and is equal to one of the selected values.
* *not in* - verify that the label name does not exist, or is not equal to any of the selected values.

If you selected *in* or *not in*, select a set of values then select *Filter*:

3. After adding filters, you can stop filtering by selecting *Clear all filters* or by clicking individual filters to remove them:

=== Creating from template

A link:templates.html[template] describes a set of resources that can be created together. To create an instance from a template using the Management Console:

1. Click on the *Create* button:
+

 +
 +
2. Select a template from the list of templates in your project, or provided by OpenShift:
+
image:../../_images/console_select_template.png["Select Template",link="../../_images/console_select_template.png"]
 +
 +

3. Modify template parameters. Labels and parameters can be modified in the template creation screen:
+
image:../../_images/create_from_template.png["Create from Template",link="../../_images/create_from_template.png"]
+
<1> Template name and description.
<2> Container images included in the template.
<3> Labels to assign to all items included in the template. You can add/edit labels for resources.
<4> Parameters defined by the template. You can edit values for parameters defined in the template here.
