== Overview
With the OpenShift management console you can visualize and browse the contents of your projects.

NOTE: JavaScript must be enabled to use the management console. For the best experience use a web browser that supports link:http://caniuse.com/#feat=websockets[websockets].

=== Navigating
The management console's navigation structure is focused around projects. The project selector allows you to switch between projects you have access to.

Navigate within a project using:

Overview:: Visualize the contents of your project with a high-level view of everything.
Browse:: Explore the different resource types within your project.

=== Filtering by labels
Every view within a project has the ability to filter the contents of the page by labels on the resources.  Pick from suggested label names and values or type in your own. Multiple filters can be added. When multiple filters are applied, resources must match all of the filters to remain visible. To filter by labels:

1. Select a label name.

2. Select one of the following:
* *exists* - verify that the label name exists, but ignore its value.
* *in* - verify that the label name exists and is equal to one of the selected values.
* *not in* - verify that the label name does not exist, or is not equal to any of the selected values.
