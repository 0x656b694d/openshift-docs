== Overview

In software systems, components can become unhealthy due to transient issues (temporary
connectivity loss), configuration errors, or problems with external dependencies.  Applications
running in OpenShift have a number of options to detect and handle unhealthy containers:

<1> Container-level liveness checks
<2> High-level application health checks

== Liveness checks

Each component in a distributed system has a notion of liveness scoped to that component.  Liveness
is the quality of being correctly configured and operational on an individual level.  To express
this, OpenShift offers a number of methods to establish container liveness and policies that
determine how 'dead' containers are handled.

== High-level application health checks

Holistic notions of application health that cut across multiple components cannot be handled with
container scoped liveness checks.  It is possible for each component in a distributed application
to be healthy and responsive but for the overall system behavior to be unhealthy.  Administrators
of distributed systems use health checks to test the behavior of a overall health of a system.  A
typical example of this type of check is a script which performs a test transaction: something
which exercises the components of the system together and verifies that the high-level behavior of
the system in the context of the test transaction matches the expected behavior of a health system.

OpenShift users can specify high-level health checks and control:

<1> The health check methodology (viz: specify a script to run)
<2> What action should be taken when a health check has a negative result (viz: create an Event)
