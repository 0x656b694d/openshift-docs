== Overview

In OpenShift, a deployment is an update to a single replication controller's pod template based on triggered events. The deployment subsystem provides:

*  link:#defining-a-deploymentConfig[Declarative definition] of a desired deployment configuration which drives automated deployments by the system
*  link:#triggers[Triggers] which drive new deployments in response to events
*  link:#rollbacks[Rollback] to a previous deployment
*  link:#strategies[Strategies] for deployment rollout behavior which are user-customizable
*  Audit history of deployed pod template configurations

==== Concepts

An OpenShift `deploymentConfig` describes a single `template` and a set of `triggers` for when a new `deployment` should be created. A `deployment` is simply a specially annotated `replicationController`. A `strategy` is responsible for making a `deployment` live in the cluster. 

Each time a new deployment is created, the `latestVersion` field of `deploymentConfig` is incremented, and a `deploymentCause` is added to the `deploymentConfig` describing the change that led to the latest deployment.

== Defining a deploymentConfig

A `deploymentConfig` in OpenShift is a REST object which can be POSTed to the API server to create a new instance. Consider a simple configuration which should result in a new `deployment` every time a Docker image tag changes.

----
{
  "kind": "DeploymentConfig",
  "apiVersion": "v1beta1",
  "metadata": {
    "name": "frontend" <1>
  },
  "template": {
    "strategy": { <2>
      "type": "Recreate"
    },
    "controllerTemplate": {
      "replicas": 1,
      "replicaSelector": {
        "name": "frontend"
      },
      "podTemplate": {
        "desiredState": {
          "manifest": {
            "version": "v1beta1",
            "containers": [
              {
                "name": "helloworld",
                "image": "openshift/openshift/origin-ruby-sample",
                "ports": [
                  {
                    "containerPort": 8080
                  }
                ]
              }
            ]
          }
        },
        "labels": {
          "name": "frontend"
        }
      }
    }
  },
  "triggers": [ <3>
    {
      "type": "ImageChange",
      "imageChangeParams": {
        "automatic": true,
        "containerNames": [
          "helloworld"
        ],
        "repositoryName": "openshift/origin-ruby-sample",
        "tag": "latest"
      }
    }
  ]
}
----

<1> This specification will create a new `deploymentConfig` named `frontend`.
<2> The Recreate `strategy` makes the `deployment` live by disabling any prior `deployment` and increasing the replica count of the new `deployment`.
<3> A single ImageChange `trigger` is defined, which causes a new `deployment` to be created each time the `openshift/origin-ruby-sample:latest` tag value changes.

## Strategies

A `deploymentConfig` has a `strategy` which is responsible for making new deployments live in the cluster. Each application has different requirements for availability (and other considerations) during deployments. OpenShift provides out-of-the-box strategies to support a variety of deployment scenarios:

===== Recreate strategy

The Recreate `strategy` has very basic behavior.

----
{
  "type": "Recreate"
}
----

The algorithm for this `strategy` is simply:

1.  Find and disable previous `deployments` (by reducing their replica count to 0)
2.  Increase the replica count of the new `deployment` to the replica count defined on the deployment configuration

===== Custom strategy

The Custom `strategy` allows users of OpenShift to provide their own deployment behavior. 

----
{
  "type": "Custom",
  "customParams": {
    "image": "organization/strategy",
    "command": ["command", "arg1"],
    "environment": [
      {
        "name": "ENV_1",
        "value": "VALUE_1"
      }
    ]
  }
}
----

With this specification, the `organization/strategy` Docker image will carry out the `strategy` behavior. The optional `command` array overrides any `CMD` directive specified in the image's Dockerfile. The optional `environment` variables provided will be added to the execution environment of the `strategy` process.

Additionally, the following environment variables are provided by OpenShift to the `strategy` process:

[cols="4,8",options="header"]
|===
|Environment Variable |Description

.^|`OPENSHIFT_DEPLOYMENT_NAME`
|The name of the new `deployment` (a `replicationController`)

.^|`OPENSHIFT_DEPLOYMENT_NAMESPACE`
|The namespace of the new `deployment`
|===

The replica count of the new `deployment` will be 0 initially. The responsibility of the `strategy` is to make the new `deployment` live using whatever logic best serves the needs of the user.

== Triggers

A `deploymentConfig` contains `triggers` which drive the creation of new deployments in response to events (both inside and outside OpenShift). The following trigger types are supported:

===== Image change triggers

The ImageChange `trigger` will result in a new deployment whenever the value of a Docker `imageRepository` tag value changes. Consider an example trigger.

----
{
  "type": "ImageChange",
  "imageChangeParams": {
    "automatic": true, <1>
    "containerNames": [
      "helloworld"
    ],
    "repositoryName": "openshift/origin-ruby-sample",
    "tag": "latest"
  }
}
----
<1> If the `automatic` option is set to `false`, the trigger is effectively disabled.

In this example, when the `latest` tag value for the `imageRepository` named `openshift/origin-ruby-sample` changes, the containers specified in `containerNames` for the `deploymentConfig` will be updated  with the new tag value, and a new `deployment` will be created.

===== Config change triggers

The ConfigChange `trigger` will result in a new deployment whenever changes are detected to the `template` of the `deploymentConfig`. Suppose the REST API is used to modify an environment variable in a container within the `template`.

----
{
  "type": "ConfigChange"
}
----

This `trigger` will cause a new `deployment` to be created in response to the `template` modification.

== Rollbacks

Rollbacks revert an application back to a previous deployment and can be performed using the REST API or the OpenShift CLI. See the link:cli.html#deployment-rollbacks[CLI documentation] for more details.
