== Overview

A project allows a community of users to organize and manage their content in isolation from other communities.

Each project may have its own 

1. resources (pods, services, replication controllers, etc.)
2. policies (who can or cannot perform an action)
3. constraints (this project may use this much quota)

== Creating a project

You can create a new project by using the following command:

****
`$ openshift ex new-project hello-openshift --description="This is an example project to demonstrate OpenShift v3" --display-name="Hello OpenShift"`
****

== Listing projects

When you list projects, you are restricted to only seeing the projects you have access to view based on policy.

You can list projects by using the following command:

****
`$ osc get projects`
****

== Using a project

You can change the current project context for CLI operations which is then used in all subsequent operations that manipulate project-scoped content.

****
`$ osc project hello-openshift`
****

== Project status

The same way `git status` provides a general overview of the working tree of a local git repository, we provide a command that shows a high level overview of the project currently in use, with its components and their relationships. This command takes no argument:

****
`$ osc status`
****

== Deleting a project

When you delete a project, the server updates the project status to Terminating from Active.  The server then clears all content from a project that is Terminating before finally removing the project.  While a project is in Terminating status, a user is unable to add new content to the project.

You can delete a project by using the following command:

****
`$ osc delete projects hello-openshift`
****
