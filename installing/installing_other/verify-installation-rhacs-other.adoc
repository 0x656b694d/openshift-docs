After installing {product-title-managed-short}, you can perform some steps to verify that the installation was successful.

:FeatureName: {product-title-managed-short}
include::snippets/field-trial.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

To verify installation, access your ACS Console from the {cloud-console}. The Dashboard will display the number of clusters that {product-title-managed-short} is monitoring, along with information about nodes, deployments, images, and violations.

If there is no data in the ACS Console:

* Ensure that at least one secured cluster is connected to your {product-title-managed-short} instance. For more information, see the "Installing secured cluster resources on each cluster" section.
* Examine your Sensor pod logs to ensure that the connection to your {product-title-managed-short} instance is successful.
* In the {ocp-short} cluster, navigate to *Platform Configuration* -> *Clusters* to verify that the components are healthy and view additional operational information.
