== Overview

Whether installing OpenShift using RPM packages or Docker images, you must first satisfy the following prerequisites.

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
== Installing Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7

As mentioned in the link:system_req.html[system requirements], a base installation of Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 7.0 is required for master or node hosts. More information on installing RHEL 7.0 can be found in the following documentation:

https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/7/html/Installation_Guide/index.html[Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 Installation Guide]

== Registering with Red Hat Network

Each system must be registered to Red Hat Network (RHN) and have a RHEL subscription attached to access required packages.

. Register the system and attach a RHEL subscription:
+
----
# subscription-manager register --username=<rhnuser> --password=<rhnpassword>
# subscription-manager list --available   (Find pool ID for RHEL subscription)
# subscription-manager attach --pool=<pool_id>
----

. Ensure the base RHEL repository is enabled, as well:
+
----
# subscription-manager repos --enable=rhel-7-server-rpms
----

. At this point, you can update the system to the latest RHEL base packages:
+
----
# yum update
----
endif::[]

== Installing Docker

Docker must be installed and running on master and node hosts before installing OpenShift.

ifdef::openshift-enterprise[]
. In RHEL 7.0, Docker is provided in the RHEL Extras repository; first, ensure the RHEL Extras repository is enabled:
+
----
# subscription-manager repos --enable=rhel-7-server-extras-rpms
----
endif::[]

. Install Docker:
+
----
# yum install docker
----

. Edit the [filename]#/etc/sysconfig/docker# file and add `--insecure-registry 172.30.17.0/24` to the [parameter]#OPTIONS# parameter. For example:
+
----
OPTIONS=--selinux-enabled -H fd:// --insecure-registry 172.30.17.0/24
----
+
The `--insecure-registry` option instructs the docker daemon to trust any docker registry on the 172.30.17.0/24 subnet, rather than requiring a certificate.
+
NOTE: These instructions assume you have not changed the kubernetes/openshift service subnet configuration from the default value of 172.30.17.0/24.

. OpenShift 3 SELinux policies are currently a work in progress. In Beta 1, SELinux must be set temporarily to Permissive or Disabled on all hosts:
+
----
# setenforce 0
----
+
You can re-enable SELinux after you are finished with:
+
----
# setenforce 1
----

. OpenShift 3 firewalld rules are also a work in progress. In Beta 1, properly configure or disable the [service]#firewalld# service. To configure it, add docker0 to the public zone:
+
----
# firewall-cmd --zone=trusted --change-interface=docker0
# systemctl restart firewalld
----
+
Alternatively, stop and disable the service:
+
----
# systemctl stop firewalld
# systemctl disable firewalld
----

. You can now enable and start the [service]#docker# service:
+
----
# systemctl enable docker
# systemctl start docker
----
