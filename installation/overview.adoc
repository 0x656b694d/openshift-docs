OpenShift can be installed using either RPMs or Docker images on hosts meeting the link:system_req.html[system requirements]. Installation packages and images are distributed by Red Hat.

For OpenShift Enterprise 3.0 Beta 1, only the link:rpm.html[RPM installation method] is available. Docker images for OpenShift components will be distributed in a later beta release.
