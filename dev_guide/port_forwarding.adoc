== Overview
You can use the CLI to forward one or more local ports to a pod. This allows you
to listen on a given or random port locally, and have data forwarded to and from
given ports in the pod.

== Basic Usage
Support for port forwarding is built into
link:../cli_reference/overview.html[the CLI]:

****
`$ osc port-forward -p _<Pod>_ _[<Local_Port>:]<Pod_Port>_ _[[<Local_Port>:]<Pod_Port> ...]_`
****

The CLI listens on each local port specified by the user, forwarding via the
link:#protocol[protocol] described below.

Ports may be specified using the following formats:

[horizontal]
`5000`:: The client listens on port 5000 locally and forwards to 5000 in the
pod.
`6000:5000`:: The client listens on port 6000 locally and forwards to 5000 in
the pod.
`:5000` or `0:5000`:: The client selects a free local port and forwards to 5000
in the pod.

For example, to listen on ports `5000` and `6000` locally and forward data to and from ports `5000` and `6000` in the pod, run:

====

----
$ osc port-forward -p mypod 5000 6000
----
====

To listen on port `8888` locally and forward to `5000` in the pod, run:

====

----
$ osc port-forward -p mypod 8888:5000
----
====

To listen on a free port locally and forward to `5000` in the pod, run:

====

----
$ osc port-forward -p mypod :5000
----
====

Or, alternatively:

====

----
$ osc port-forward -p mypod 0:5000
----
====

== Protocol
Clients initiate port forwarding to a pod by issuing a request to the
Kubernetes API server:

****
`/proxy/minions/_<Node_Name>_/portForward/_<Namespace>_/_<Pod>_`
****

In the above URL:

- `_Node_Name_` is the FQDN of the node.
- `_Namespace_` is the namespace of the target pod.
- `_Pod_` is the name of the target pod.

For example:

====

[options="nowrap"]
----
/proxy/minions/node123.openshift.com/portForward/myns/mypod
----
====

After sending a port forward request to the API server, the client upgrades the
connection to one that supports multiplexed streams; the current implementation
uses link:http://www.chromium.org/spdy[*SPDY*].

The client creates a stream with the `port` header containing the target port in
the pod. All data written to the stream is delivered via the Kubelet to the
target pod and port. Similarly, all data sent from the pod for that forwarded
connection is delivered back to the same stream in the client.

The client closes all streams, the upgraded connection, and the underlying
connection when it is finished with the port forwarding request.

NOTE: Administrators can see the link:../architecture/additional_concepts/port_forwarding.html[Architecture] guide for more information.
