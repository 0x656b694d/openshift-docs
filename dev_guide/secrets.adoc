== Overview

The `Secrets` resource provides a mechanism to hold sensitive information such as passwords,
client config files for OpenShift, `dockercfg`s, etc.  Secrets decouple sensitive content from
the pods that use it and can be mounted into containers using a volume plugin or used by the
system to perform actions on behalf of a pod.  This topic discusses important properties of 
secrets and provides an overview on how developers can use them.
