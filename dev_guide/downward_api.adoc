== Overview

It is common for containers to consume information about API objects.  The downward API is a
mechanism that allows containers to do this without coupling to OpenShift.  Containers can consume
information from the downward API via environment variables or a volume plugin.

== Selecting fields

Fields within the pod are selected using the `FieldRef` API type.  `FieldRef` has two fields:

<1> `fieldPath`: The path of the field to select, relative to the pod
<2> `apiVersion`:  The api version to intepret the fieldPath selector within

Currently, there are four valid selectors in the `v1` API:

<1> `metadata.name`: the pod's name
<2> `metadata.namespace`: the pod's namespace
<3> `metadata.labels`: the pod's labels
<4> `metadata.annotations`: the pod's annotations

The `apiVersion` field, if not specified, defaults to the API version of the enclosing pod
template.

In the future more information, such as resource limits for pods and information about services,
will be available via the downward API.

== Consuming via environment variables

One mechanism for consuming the downward API is via a container's environment variables.  The
`EnvVar` type's `valueFrom` field (of type `EnvVarSource`) is used to specify that the variable's
value should come from a `FieldRef` source instead of the literal value specified by the `value`
field.  In the future, additional sources may be supported; currently the source's `fieldRef`
field is used to select a field from the downward API:

Only constant attributes of the pod can be consumed this way, as environment variables cannot be
updated once a process is started in a way that allows the process to be notified that the value
of a variable has changed.  The fields supported via environment variables are:

<1>  The pod's name
<2>  The pod's namespace

As an example:

. Create a `*_pod.json_*` file:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: dapi-env-test-pod
spec:
  containers:
    - name: env-test-container
      image: gcr.io/google_containers/busybox
      command: [ "/bin/sh", "-c", "env" ]
      env:
        - name: MY_POD_NAME
          valueFrom:
            fieldRef:
              fieldPath: metadata.name
        - name: MY_POD_NAMESPACE
          valueFrom:
            fieldRef:
              fieldPath: metadata.namespace
  restartPolicy: Never
----

. Create the pod from the `*_pod.json_*` file:

====
----
$ oc create -f pod.json
----
====

. Check the container's logs with:

====
----
$ oc logs -p dapi-env-test-pod
----
====

You should see `MY_POD_NAME` and `MY_POD_NAMESPACE` in the logs.

== Consuming via volume plugin

Another mechanism for consuming the downward API is the volume plug-in.  The downward API volume
plug-in creates a volume with configured fields projected into files.  The `metadata` field of the
`*VolumeSource*` API resource is used to configure this volume.  The plug-in supports the following
fields:

<1>  Pod name
<2>  Pod namespace
<3>  Pod annotations
<4>  Pod labels

Let's look at a small example of how the volume plug-in is configured:

[source,yaml]
====
----
spec:
  volumes:
    - name: podinfo
      metadata: <1>
        items:  <2>
          - name: "labels" <3>
            fieldRef:
              fieldPath: metadata.labels <4>
----

<1> The `metadata` field of the volume source configures the downward API volume
<2> The `items` field holds a list of fields to project into the volume
<3> The name of the file to project the field into
<4> The selector of the field to project 
====

Let's take a look at a full example:

. Create a `*_volume-pod.json_*` file:

[source,yaml]
----
kind: Pod
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  labels:
    zone: us-east-coast
    cluster: downward-api-test-cluster1
    rack: rack-123
  name: dapi-volume-test-pod
  annotations:
    annotation1: 345
    annotation2: 456 
spec:
  containers:
    - name: volume-test-container
      image: gcr.io/google_containers/busybox
      command: ["sh", "-c", "cat /etc/labels /etc/annotations"]
      volumeMounts:
        - name: podinfo
          mountPath: /etc
          readOnly: false
  volumes:
    - name: podinfo
      metadata:
        items:
          - name: "labels"
            fieldRef:
              fieldPath: metadata.labels
          - name: "annotations"
            fieldRef:
              fieldPath: metadata.annotations
  restartPolicy: Never
----

. Create the pod from the `*_volume-pod.json_*` file:

====
----
$ oc create -f volume-pod.json
----
====

. Check the container's logs with:

====
----
$ oc logs -p dapi-volume-test-pod
cluster=downward-api-test-cluster1
rack=rack-123
zone=us-east-coast
annotation1=345
annotation2=456
