== Overview

A *ResourceQuota* object enumerates hard resource usage limits per project.  It 
can limit the total number of a particular type of object that may be created in 
a project, and the total amount of compute resources that may be consumed by 
resources in that project.

== Usage limits

The following describes the set of limits that may be enforced by a *ResourceQuota*.

.Usage limits
[cols="3a,8a",options="header"]
|===

|Resource Name |Description

|`cpu`
|Total cpu usage across all containers

|`memory`
|Total memory usage across all containers

|`pods`
|Total number of pods

|`replicationcontrollers`
|Total number of replication controllers

|`resourcequotas`
|Total number of resource quotas

|`services`
|Total number of services

|`secrets`
|Total number of secrets

|`persistentvolumeclaims`
|Total number of persistent volume claims
|===

== Quota enforcement

After a quota is first created in a project, the project restricts the ability to 
create any new resources that may violate a quota constraint until it has calculated 
updated usage statistics.

Once a quota is created and usage statistics are up-to-date, the project accepts the 
creation of new content. When you create resources, your quota usage is incremented 
immediately upon the request to create or modify the resource. When you delete 
a resource, your quota use is decremented during the next full recalculation of 
quota statistics for the project. As a result, it may take a moment for your quota 
usage statistics to be reduced to their current observed system value when you 
delete resources.

If your modification to a project would exceed a quota usage limit, the action 
is denied by the server, and an appropriate error message is returned to the 
end-user. The error explains what quota constraint was violated, and what their 
currently observed usage stats are in the system.

== Create a Quota

To apply a quota to a project: 

****
`$ oc create -f resource-quota.json`
****

== View a Quota

To view usage statistics related to any hard limits defined in your quota: 

----
$ oc get quota
