== Management Console Authentication
When accessing the Management Console from a browser at
`<master-public-addr>:8443`, you are automatically redirected to a login page:

image:login_page.png["Management Console Login Page"]

You can provide your login credentials on this page to obtain a token to make
API calls. After logging in, you can navigate your projects
link:console.html[using the Management Console].

== CLI Authentication
You can authenticate from the command line using the CLI command `osc login`.
You can link:../cli_reference/get_started_cli.html[get started with the CLI] by
running this command without any options:

****
`$ osc login`
****

The command's interactive flow helps you establish a session to an OpenShift
server with the provided credentials. If any information required to successfully
log in to an OpenShift server is not provided, the command prompts for user
input as required. The
link:../cli_reference/get_started_cli.html#cli-configuration-files[configuration]
is automatically saved and is then used for every subsequent command.

All configuration options for the `osc login` command, listed in the `osc login
--help` command output, are optional. The following example shows usage with
some common options:

****
`$ osc login [--username=_<username>_]  [--password=_<password>_] [--server=_<server>_] [--certificate-authority=_</path/to/file.crt>_|--insecure-skip-tls-verify]`
****

The following table describes these common options:

.Common CLI Configuration Options
[cols="4,8",options="header"]
|===

|Option |Description

.^|`-s, --server`
|This option allows you to specify the host name of the OpenShift server. If a
server is provided through this flag, the command will not ask for it
interactively. This flag can also be used if you already have a CLI
configuration file and want to log in and switch to another server.

.^|`-u, --username` and `-p, --password`
|This option allows you to specify the credentials to log in to the OpenShift
server. If user name or password are provided through these flags, the command
will not ask for it interactively. These flags can also be used if you already
have a configuration file with a session token established and want to log in and
switch to another user name.

.^|`--certificate-authority`
|This option is used to correctly and securely authenticate with an OpenShift
server that uses HTTPS. The path to a certificate authority file must be
provided.

.^|`--insecure-skip-tls-verify`
|This option allows interaction with an HTTPS server bypassing the server
certificate checks; however, note that it is not secure. If you try to `osc
login` to a HTTPS server that does not provide a valid certificate and this or
the `--certificate-authority` flags were not provided, `osc login` will prompt
for user input to confirm (`y/N` kind of input) about connecting insecurely.

You can easily link:../cli_reference/setup_multiple_cli_profiles.html[configure and manage multiple CLI
profiles] using the `osc config` command.
