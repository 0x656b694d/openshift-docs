== Overview
A deployment in OpenShift is an update to a single replication controller's
pod template based on triggered events. The `*deployment*` subsystem provides:

- A link:#defining-a-deploymentConfig[declarative definition] of a desired deployment configuration which drives automated deployments by the system.
- link:#triggers[Triggers] which drive new deployments in response to events.
- link:#rollbacks[Rollbacks] to a previous deployment.
- link:#strategies[Strategies] for deployment rollout behavior which are user-customizable.
- Audit history of deployed pod template configurations.

A `*deploymentConfig*` describes a single link:templates.html[template] and a
set of link:#triggers[triggers] for when a new deployment should be created.
A deployment is simply a specially annotated `*replicationController*`. A
link:#strategies[strategy] is responsible for making a deployment live in the
cluster.

Each time a new deployment is created, the `*latestVersion*` field of
`*deploymentConfig*` is incremented. A `*deploymentCause*` is also added to the
`*deploymentConfig*` describing the change that led to the latest deployment.

== Defining a deploymentConfig
A `*deploymentConfig*` is a REST object which can be used in a `POST`  to the
API server to create a new instance. Consider the following simple, but
complete, configuration which should result in a new deployment every time a
Docker image tag changes:

====

              {

                  }
                ]
              }
            ]
          }
        },

          "helloworld"
        ],
        "repositoryName": "openshift/origin-ruby-sample",
        "tag": "latest"
      }
    }
  ]
}
----

<1> This specification will create a new `*deploymentConfig*` named
`*frontend*`.
<2> The Recreate `*strategy*` makes the deployment live by disabling any prior
`deployment` and increasing the replica count of the new `deployment`.
<3> A single `*ImageChange*` trigger is defined, which causes a new deployment
to be created each time the *openshift/origin-ruby-sample:latest* tag value
changes.
====

== Strategies
A `*deploymentConfig*` has a `*strategy*` which is responsible for making new
deployments live in the cluster. Each application has different requirements for
availability (and other considerations) during deployments. OpenShift provides
out-of-the-box strategies to support a variety of deployment scenarios:

*Recreate Strategy* [[recreate-strategy]]

The `*Recreate*` `*strategy*` has basic rollout behavior, and supports
link:#lifecycle-hooks[lifecycle hooks] for injecting code into the deployment
process.

====

[source,json]
----
{
  "type": "Recreate",
  "recreateParams": { <1>
    "pre": {}, <2>
    "post": {}
  }
}
----

<1> `*recreateParams*` are optional.
<2> `*pre*` and `*post*` are both link:#lifecycle-hooks[lifecycle hooks].
====

The algorithm for the `*Recreate*``*strategy*` is:

. Execute any `*pre*` lifecycle hook.
. Increase the replica count of the new deployment to the replica count
defined on the deployment configuration.
. Find and disable previous deployments by reducing their replica count to `0`.
. Execute any `post` lifecycle hook

link:#lifecycle-hooks[Lifecycle hooks] are specified in the `*recreateParams*`
for the strategy.

IMPORTANT: The `*Abort*` lifecycle hook failure policy is not supported for the
`*post*` hook in this strategy; any `*post*` hook failure will be ignored.

*Custom Strategy* [[custom-strategy]]

The `*Custom*` `*strategy*` allows users of OpenShift to provide their own
deployment behavior.

====

[source,json]
----
{
  "type": "Custom",
  "customParams": {
    "image": "organization/strategy",
    "command": ["command", "arg1"],
    "environment": [
      {
        "name": "ENV_1",
        "value": "VALUE_1"
      }
    ]
  }
}
----
====

With this specification, the *organization/strategy* Docker image carries out
the `*strategy*` behavior. The optional `*command*` array overrides any `CMD`
directive specified in the image's *_Dockerfile_*. The optional `*environment*`
variables provided are added to the execution environment of the `*strategy*`
process.

Additionally, the following environment variables are provided by OpenShift to
the `*strategy*` process:

[cols="4,8",options="header"]
|===
|Environment Variable |Description

.^|`*OPENSHIFT_DEPLOYMENT_NAME*`
|The name of the new deployment (a `*replicationController*`).

.^|`*OPENSHIFT_DEPLOYMENT_NAMESPACE*`
|The namespace of the new deployment.
|===

The replica count of the new deployment will be `0` initially. The
responsibility of the `*strategy*` is to make the new deployment live using
whatever logic best serves the needs of the user.

== Lifecycle Hooks
Deployment strategies may support lifecycle hooks, which allow you to
inject behavior into the deployment process at predefined points within the
strategy. Consider this partially defined hook:

====

[source,json]
----
{
  "failurePolicy": "Abort",
  "execNewPod": {} <1>
}
----
<1> `*execNewPod*` is the type of this lifecycle hook, and is
link:#pod-based-lifecycle-hook[documented separately].
====

Every hook has a `*failurePolicy*` which defines the action the strategy should take when a hook failure is encountered. Possible values are:

[horizontal]
Abort:: The deployment should be considered a failure if the hook fails.
Retry:: The hook execution should be retried until it succeeds.
Ignore:: Any hook failure should be ignored and the deployment should proceeed.

WARNING: Some hook points for a strategy might support only a subset of
`*failurePolicy*` values. For example, the `*Recreate*` strategy does not
currently support the `*Abort*` policy for its `*post*` deployment lifecycle
hook point. Check the documentation for a given strategy to learn more about its
support for lifecycle hooks.

Hooks have a type specific field which describes how to execute the hook.
Currently `*execNewPod*` is the only supported type.

*Pod-based Lifecycle Hook* [[pod-based-lifecycle-hook]]

The `*execNewPod*` hook type executes lifecycle hook code in a new pod derived
from the pod template in a `*deploymentConfig*`. Consider this simplified
example `*deploymentConfig*` which uses the link:#recreate-strategy[`*Recreate*`
`*strategy*`].

====

[source,json]
----
{
  "kind": "DeploymentConfig",
  "template": {
    "strategy": {
      "type": "Recreate",
      "recreateParams": {
        "pre": {
          "failurePolicy": "Abort",
          "execNewPod": {
            "containerName": "helloworld", <1>
            "command": [ <2>
              "/usr/bin/command", "arg1", "arg2"
            ],
            "env": [ <3>
              {
                "name": "CUSTOM_VAR1",
                "value": "custom_value1"
              }
            ]
          }
        }
      }
    },
    "controllerTemplate": {
      "replicas": 1,
      "podTemplate": {
        "desiredState": {
          "manifest": {
            "version": "v1beta1",
            "containers": [
              {
                "name": "helloworld",
                "image": "openshift/origin-ruby-sample"
              }
            ]
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
----
<1> `*containerName*` corresponds to `*podTemplate.containers[0].name*`.
<2> `*command*` overrides any `ENTRYPOINT` defined in the image used by
`*containerName*`.
<3> `*env*` is an optional set of environment variables for the hook container.
====

In this example, the `*pre*` hook will be executed in a new pod using the
*openshift/origin-ruby-sample* image from the *helloworld* container. The hook
command will be `/usr/bin/command arg1 arg2`, and the hook pod will have
`*CUSTOM_VAR1=custom_value1*` in its environment. Because the `*failurePolicy*`
is `*Abort*`, if the hook fails, the deployment will fail (as supported by the
`*Recreate*` `*strategy*`).

== Triggers

A `*deploymentConfig*` contains triggers which drive the creation of new
deployments in response to events, both inside and outside OpenShift. The
following trigger types are supported:

*_ImageChange_ Triggers* [[image-change-triggers]]

The `*ImageChange*` trigger results in a new deployment whenever the value
of a Docker `*imageRepository*` tag value changes. Consider an example trigger:

====

[source,json]
----
{
  "type": "ImageChange",
  "imageChangeParams": {
    "automatic": true, <1>
    "containerNames": [
      "helloworld"
    ],
    "repositoryName": "openshift/origin-ruby-sample",
    "tag": "latest"
  }
}
----
<1> If the `*automatic*` option is set to `*false*`, the trigger is effectively
disabled.
====

In this example, when the `*latest*` tag value for the `*imageRepository*` named
*openshift/origin-ruby-sample* changes, the containers specified in
`*containerNames*` for the `*deploymentConfig*` will be updated  with the new
tag value, and a new deployment will be created.

*_ConfigChange_ Triggers* [[configchange-triggers]]

The `*ConfigChange*` trigger results in a new deployment whenever changes are
detected to the `*template*` of the `*deploymentConfig*`:

====

[source,json]
----
{
  "type": "ConfigChange"
}
----
====

For example, if the REST API is used to modify an environment variable in a
container within the `*template*`, this trigger will cause a new deployment to
be created in response to the `*template*` modification.

== Rollbacks
Rollbacks revert an application back to a previous deployment and can be
performed using the REST API or the CLI. See the
link:../cli_reference/basic_cli_operations.html#deployment-operations[CLI
Reference] for more details.
