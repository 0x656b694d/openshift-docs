== Overview
A deployment in OpenShift is an update to a single replication controller's pod
template based on triggered events. The `*deployment*` subsystem provides:

- A link:#defining-a-deploymentConfig[deploymentconfig] that drives automated deployments by the system.
- link:#triggers[Triggers] which drive new deployments in response to events.
- User-customizable link:#strategies[strategies] for deployment rollout behavior, which are responsible for making a deployment live in the cluster.
- link:#rollbacks[Rollbacks] to a previous deployment.
- Replication link:#scaling[scaling].
- An audit history of deployed pod template configurations.

The deployment configuration has a version parameter value that increases in increments of one each time a new deployment is created from that configuration. In addition, the cause of the last deployment is added to the configuration.

== Defining a deploymentConfig

A `*deploymentConfig*` describes a single link:templates.html[template] and a
set of link:#triggers[triggers] for when a new deployment should be created.
A deployment is simply a specially annotated `*replicationController*`.

A `*deploymentConfig*` is a REST object, which can be used in a `POST` to the
API server to create a new instance. The following configuration results in a
new deployment every time a Docker image tag changes:

<1> This specification will create a new `*deploymentConfig*` named
`*frontend*`.
<2> The link:#strategies[`*Recreate*` strategy] makes the deployment live by
disabling any prior `deployment` and increasing the replica count of the new
`deployment`.
<3> A single `*ImageChange*` trigger, which causes a new deployment to be
created each time the "repositoryName" and "tag" parameter values change.
====

== Strategies
A `*deploymentConfig*` has a strategy which is responsible for making new
deployments live in the cluster. Each application has different requirements for
availability (and other considerations) during deployments. OpenShift provides
out-of-the-box strategies to support a variety of deployment scenarios:

=== Recreate Strategy [[recreate-strategy]]

The `*Recreate*` strategy has basic rollout behavior, and supports
link:#lifecycle-hooks[lifecycle hooks] for injecting code into the deployment
process.

====

[source,json]
----
{
  "type": "Recreate",
  "recreateParams": { <1>
    "pre": {}, <2>
    "post": {}
  }
}
----

<1> `*recreateParams*` are optional.
<2> `*pre*` and `*post*` are both link:#lifecycle-hooks[lifecycle hooks].
====

The `*Recreate*` strategy order of operations is to:

. Execute any `*pre*` lifecycle hook.
. Increase the replica count of the new deployment to the replica count
defined on the deployment configuration.
. Find and disable previous deployments by reducing their replica count to zero.
. Execute any `post` lifecycle hook.

link:#lifecycle-hooks[Lifecycle hooks] are specified in the `*recreateParams*`
for the strategy.

IMPORTANT: The `*Abort*` lifecycle hook failure policy is not supported for the
`*post*` hook in this strategy; any `*post*` hook failure will be ignored.

=== Custom Strategy [[custom-strategy]]

The `*Custom*` strategy allows you to provide your own deployment behavior:

====

[source,json]
----
{
  "type": "Custom",
  "customParams": {
    "image": "organization/strategy",
    "command": ["command", "arg1"],
    "environment": [
      {
        "name": "ENV_1",
        "value": "VALUE_1"
      }
    ]
  }
}
----
====

In the above example, the *organization/strategy* Docker image carries out the
strategy behavior. The optional `*command*` array overrides any `CMD` directive
specified in the image's *_Dockerfile_*. The optional environment variables
provided are added to the execution environment of the strategy process.

Additionally, OpenShift provides the following environment variables to the
strategy process:

[cols="4,8",options="header"]
|===
|Environment Variable |Description

.^|`*OPENSHIFT_DEPLOYMENT_NAME*`
|The name of the new deployment (a `*replicationController*`).

.^|`*OPENSHIFT_DEPLOYMENT_NAMESPACE*`
|The namespace of the new deployment.
|===

The replica count of the new deployment will initially be `0`. The
responsibility of the strategy is to make the new deployment live using the
logic that best serves the needs of the user.

=== Deployment resources
A deployment is completed by a pod that consumes *resources* (memory and cpu) on a node.
By default, pods consume unbounded node resources.
However, if a project specifies default container limits, then pods consume resources up to those limits.
Another way to limit resource use is to specify resource limits as part of the deployment strategy.
In the following example, each of `resources`, `cpu`, and `memory` is optional.

====

[source,json]
----
{
  "type": "Recreate",
  "resources": {
    "limits": {
      "cpu": "100m", <1>
      "memory": "256Mi" <2>
    }
  },
}
----

<1> `*cpu*` is in cpu units; `100m` represents 0.1 cpu units (`100 * 1e-3`)
<2> `*memory*` is in bytes; `256Mi` represents 268435456 bytes (`256 * 2 ^ 20`)
====

== Lifecycle Hooks
Deployment strategies support lifecycle hooks, which allow you to inject
behavior into the deployment process at predefined points within the strategy:

====

[source,json]
----
{
  "failurePolicy": "Abort",
  "execNewPod": {} <1>
}
----
<1> `*execNewPod*` is link:#pod-based-lifecycle-hook[a pod-based lifecycle hook].
====

Every hook has a `*failurePolicy*`, which defines the action the strategy should
take when a hook failure is encountered:

[cols="2,8"]
|===

.^|`*Abort*`
|The deployment should be considered a failure if the hook fails.

.^|`*Retry*`
|The hook execution should be retried until it succeeds.

.^|`*Ignore*`
|Any hook failure should be ignored and the deployment should proceeed.
|===

WARNING: Some hook points for a strategy might support only a subset of
`*failurePolicy*` values. For example, the `*Recreate*` strategy does not
currently support the `*Abort*` policy for its `*post*` deployment lifecycle
hook point. Check the link:#recreate-strategy[`*Recreate*` strategy] section for
more information about support for lifecycle hooks.

Hooks have a type specific field that describes how to execute the hook.
Currently `*execNewPod*` is the only supported type.

=== Pod-based Lifecycle Hook [[pod-based-lifecycle-hook]]

The `*execNewPod*` hook type executes lifecycle hook code in a new pod derived
from the pod template in a `*deploymentConfig*`. The following example
`*deploymentConfig*` uses the link:#recreate-strategy[`*Recreate*` strategy].

====

[source,json]
----
{
  "kind": "DeploymentConfig",
  "template": {
    "strategy": {
      "type": "Recreate",
      "recreateParams": {
        "pre": {
          "failurePolicy": "Abort",
          "execNewPod": {
            "containerName": "helloworld", <1>
            "command": [ <2>
              "/usr/bin/command", "arg1", "arg2"
            ],
            "env": [ <3>
              {
                "name": "CUSTOM_VAR1",
                "value": "custom_value1"
              }
            ]
          }
        }
      }
    },
    "controllerTemplate": {
      "replicas": 1,
      "podTemplate": {
        "desiredState": {
          "manifest": {
            "version": "v1beta1",
            "containers": [
              {
                "name": "helloworld",
                "image": "openshift/origin-ruby-sample"
              }
            ]
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
----
<1> `*containerName*` must match a container from the pod template; "helloworld" is the only valid `containerName` in this example.
<2> `*command*` overrides any `ENTRYPOINT` defined in the image used by
`*containerName*`.
<3> `*env*` is an optional set of environment variables for the hook container.
====

In this example, the `*pre*` hook will be executed in a new pod using the
*openshift/origin-ruby-sample* image from the *helloworld* container. The hook
command will be `/usr/bin/command arg1 arg2`, and the hook pod will have the
`*CUSTOM_VAR1=custom_value1*` environment variable. Because the
`*failurePolicy*` is `*Abort*`, if the hook fails, the deployment will fail (as
supported by the `*Recreate*` strategy).

== Triggers

A `*deploymentConfig*` contains triggers, which drive the creation of new
deployments in response to events, both inside and outside OpenShift.

=== ImageChange Triggers [[image-change-triggers]]

The `*ImageChange*` trigger results in a new deployment whenever the value
of a Docker `*imageRepository*` tag value changes:

====

[source,json]
----
{
  "type": "ImageChange",
  "imageChangeParams": {
    "automatic": true, <1>
    "containerNames": [
      "helloworld"
    ],
    "repositoryName": "openshift/origin-ruby-sample",
    "tag": "latest"
  }
}
----
<1> If the `*automatic*` option is set to `*false*`, the trigger is effectively
disabled.
====

Using the above example, when the `*tag*` value for the image is updated, a new
deployment is created using the updated configuration. Then, the deployment is
rolled out using the specified strategy.

=== ConfigChange Triggers [[configchange-triggers]]

The `*ConfigChange*` trigger results in a new deployment whenever changes are
detected to the `*template*` of the `*deploymentConfig*`:

====

[source,json]
----
{
  "type": "ConfigChange"
}
----
====

For example, if the REST API is used to modify an environment variable in a
container within the `*template*`, this trigger will launch a new deployment in
response to the `*template*` modification.

== Rollbacks
Rollbacks revert an application back to a previous deployment and can be
performed using the REST API or the CLI. See the
link:../cli_reference/basic_cli_operations.html#deployment-operations[CLI
Reference] for more details.

== Scaling
In addition to rollbacks, you can exercise fine-grained control over
the number of replicas by using the `oc scale` command.
For example, the following command sets the replicas in the deployment
configuration `frontend` to 3.

----
$ oc scale dc frontend --replicas=3
----

The number of replicas eventually propagates to the desired and current
state of the deployment configured by the deployment configuration `frontend`.
