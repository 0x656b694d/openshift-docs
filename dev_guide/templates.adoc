== Overview
A template describes a set of
link:../architecture/core_objects/overview.html[resources] that can be
customized and processed to produce a configuration. Each template is a
parameterized list that is used by OpenShift to create a list of resources,
including services, pods, routes, buildconfigs, etc. A template also defines a
set of labels to apply to every resource created by the template.

.Sample Template JSON File:
====

----
{
  "apiVersion": "v1",
  "kind": "Template",
  "metadata": {
    "name": "Template_Name", <1>
    "annotations": {
      "description": "Description" <2>
    }
  },
  "parameters": [ <3>
    {
      "name": "username"
      "value": "admin"
      "description": "administrative user"
    }
  ],
  "labels": { <4>
    "custom_label": "Label_Name"
  },
  "objects": [ <5>
    {
      ...
    }
  ]
}
----

<1> The name of the template
<2> Optional description for the template
<3> A list of parameters for the template
<4> A list of labels to apply to resources
<5> A list of resources to create

== Creating a Configuration From a Template
You can create a configuration from a template using the CLI or, if a template
has been uploaded to your project or global template library, using the web
console.

Create a template JSON file, like the above example, then upload it with the
CLI using the following process:

=== Uploading a Template
You can upload a template to your current project's template library by passing
a JSON file with the following command:

----
$ oc create -f <filename>
----

You can upload a template to a different project using the `-n` option with the
name of the project:

----
$ oc create -f <filename> -n <project>
----

The template is now available to be selected for a configuration using the web
console or the CLI.

=== Generating a Configuration
Generate a configuration with the following command:

----
$ oc process -f <filename>
----

Alternatively, you can create from a template without uploading it to the
template library by processing the template and creating from the same template
by piping both commands:

----
$ oc process -f <filename.json> | oc create -f -
----

You can override any link:../dev_guide/templates.html#parameters[parameters]
defined in the JSON file by adding the `-v` option followed by a
comma-separated list of _<name>_=_<value>_ pairs.
A parameter reference may appear in any text field inside the template items.

For example, you can override the *`ADMIN_USERNAME`* and *`MYSQL_DATABASE`*
parameters to create a configuration with customized environment variables:

.Generating a Configuration
====

[options="nowrap"]
----
$ oc process -f examples/sample-app/application-template-dockerbuild.json \
    -v ADMIN_USERNAME=root,MYSQL_DATABASE=admin
----

====

The JSON file can either be redirected to a file or applied directly without
uploading the template by piping the process output to the `create` command:

====

[options="nowrap"]
----
$ oc process -f examples/sample-app/application-template-dockerbuild.json \
    -v ADMIN_USERNAME=root,MYSQL_DATABASE=admin \
    | oc create -f -
----

====

=== Using the Web Console

To create a configuration from an link:#uploading-a-template[uploaded template]
using the web console:

1. While in the desired project, click on the *Create+* button:
+
====

image:console_create.png["Console Create"]
====

2. Select a template from the list of templates in your project, or provided by
the global template library:
+
====

image:console_select_template.png["Select Template"]
====

3. Modify template parameters in the template creation screen:
+
====

image:create_from_template.png["Create from Template"]
====
+
<1> Template name and description.
<2> Container images included in the template.
<3> Labels to assign to all items included in the template. You can add and edit
labels for resources.
<4> Parameters defined by the template. You can edit values for parameters
defined in the template here.

=== Modifying an Uploaded Template
You can edit a template that has already been uploaded to your project by using
the following command:

----
$ oc edit template <template>
----

== Labels
link:../architecture/core_objects/kubernetes_model.html#label[Labels]
are used to manage and organize generated resources, such as pods. The labels
specified in the template are applied to every resource that is generated from
the template.

There is also the ability to add labels in the template from the command line.

----
$ oc process -f <filename> -l name=otherLabel
----

== Parameters
The list of parameters that you can override are listed in the `*parameters*`
section of the template. You can list them with the CLI by using the following
command and specifying the file to be used:

----
$ oc process --parameters -f <filename>
----

The following shows the output when listing the parameters for one of the
https://github.com/openshift/origin/tree/master/examples/sample-app[*_sample-app_*]
templates:

====

----
$ oc process --parameters -f examples/sample-app/application-template-dockerbuild.json NAME
DESCRIPTION              GENERATOR           VALUE ADMIN_USERNAME
administrator username   expression          admin[A-Z0-9]{3} ADMIN_PASSWORD
administrator password   expression          [a-zA-Z0-9]{8} MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
database password        expression          [a-zA-Z0-9]{8} MYSQL_DATABASE
database name                                root
----

====

The output identifies several parameters that are generated with a regex
expression generator when the template is processed.

== Using the QuickStart Templates
OpenShift provides a number of templates in the box to make it easy to quickly get started creating a new application for different languages.  Templates are provided for Rails(Ruby), Django(Python), NodeJS, CakePHP(PHP), and Dancer(Perl).  Your administrator should have registered these templates in the `openshift` project so you have access to them.  If not, direct him or her to the link:../admin_guide/install/first_steps.html[first steps] guide.

By default, the templates will build using a public source repository on GitHub that contains the necessary application code.  In order to be able to modify the source and build your own version of the application, you will need to fork the repository referenced by the template's default `SOURCE_REPOSITORY_URL` parameter.  You should then override the value of that parameter when creating from the template.  By doing this, the BuildConfig created by the template will now point to your fork of the application code and you can modify the code and rebuild the application at will.
