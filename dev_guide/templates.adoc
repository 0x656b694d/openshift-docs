== Overview
A link:../architecture/core_concepts/templates.html[template] describes
a set of link:../architecture/core_concepts/overview.html[objects]
that can be parameterized and processed to produce a list of objects
for creation by OpenShift. A template can be processed to create
anything you have permission to create within a project, for example
link:../architecture/core_concepts/pods_and_services.html#services[services],
link:../architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.html#builds[build
configurations], and
link:../architecture/core_concepts/deployments.html#deployments-and-deployment-configurations[deployment
configurations]. A template may also define a set of
link:../architecture/core_concepts/pods_and_services.html#labels[labels]
to apply to every object defined in the template.

[[creating-resources-from-a-template]]

== Creating Resources from a Template
You can create a list of resources from a template using the CLI or, if a template
has been uploaded to your project or global template library, using the web
console.

Create a template JSON or YAML file (similar to
link:../architecture/core_concepts/templates.html[this example]); then
upload it with the CLI using the following process.

[[uploading-a-template]]

=== Uploading a Template
You can upload a template to your current project's template library by passing
a JSON or YAML file with the following command:

----
$ oc create -f <filename>
----

You can upload a template to a different project using the `-n` option with the
name of the project:

----
$ oc create -f <filename> -n <project>
----

The template is now available to be selected for a configuration using the web
console or the CLI.

[[generating-a-list-of-resources]]

=== Generating a List of Resources
Process the template and return the list of resources to standard output:

----
$ oc process -f <filename>
----

You can also process an uploaded template by calling the `process` command using:

----
$ oc process uploaded-template-name
----

The process command also takes a list of templates you can process to a list of
resources. In that case, every template will be processed and the resulting list
of resources will contain objects from all templates passed to a process command:

----
$ cat <first_template> <second_template> | oc process -f -
----

Alternatively, you can create from a template without uploading it to the
template library by processing the template and creating from the same template
by piping both commands:

----
$ oc process -f <filename.json> | oc create -f -
----

You can override any link:../dev_guide/templates.html#parameters[parameter]
values defined in the file by adding the `-v` option followed by a
comma-separated list of _<name>_=_<value>_ pairs.
A parameter reference may appear in any text field inside the template items.

For example, you can override the *`ADMIN_USERNAME`* and *`MYSQL_DATABASE`*
parameters to create a configuration with customized environment variables:

.Creating list of resources from a template
====

[options="nowrap"]
----
$ oc process -f examples/sample-app/application-template-dockerbuild.json \
    -v ADMIN_USERNAME=root,MYSQL_DATABASE=admin
----

====

The JSON file can either be redirected to a file or applied directly without
uploading the template by piping the process output to the `create` command:

====

[options="nowrap"]
----
$ oc process -f examples/sample-app/application-template-dockerbuild.json \
    -v ADMIN_USERNAME=root,MYSQL_DATABASE=admin \
    | oc create -f -
----

====

[[using-the-web-console]]

=== Using the Web Console

To create the resources from an link:#uploading-a-template[uploaded template]
using the web console:

1. While in the desired project, click *Add to Project*:
+
====

image::console_create.png["Console Create"]
====

2. Select a template from the list of templates in your project, or provided by
the global template library:
+
====

image::console_select_template.png["Select Template"]
====

3. Modify template parameters in the template creation screen:
+
====

image::create_from_template.png["Create from Template"]
====
+
<1> Template name and description.
<2> Container images included in the template.
<3> Parameters defined by the template. You can edit values for parameters
defined in the template here.
<4> link:#templates-labels[Labels] to assign to all items included in the
template. You can add and edit labels for objects.


[[modifying-an-uploaded-template]]

=== Modifying an Uploaded Template
You can edit a template that has already been uploaded to your project by using
the following command:

----
$ oc edit template <template>
----

[[templates-labels]]

=== Labels
link:../architecture/core_concepts/pods_and_services.html#labels[Labels] are
used to manage and organize generated resources, such as pods. The labels
specified in the template are applied to every resource that is generated from
the template.

There is also the ability to add labels in the template from the command line.

----
$ oc process -f <filename> -l name=otherLabel
----

[[parameters]]

=== Parameters
The list of parameters that you can override are listed in the
link:../architecture/core_concepts/templates.html#parameters[`*parameters*`
section of the template]. You can list them with the CLI by using the following
command and specifying the file to be used:

----
$ oc process --parameters -f <filename>
----

The following shows the output when listing the parameters for one of the
https://github.com/openshift/origin/tree/master/examples/sample-app[*_sample-app_*]
templates:

====
----
$ oc process --parameters -f \
    examples/sample-app/application-template-dockerbuild.json
NAME                DESCRIPTION              GENERATOR           VALUE
ADMIN_USERNAME      administrator username   expression          admin[A-Z0-9]{3}
ADMIN_PASSWORD      administrator password   expression          [a-zA-Z0-9]{8}
MYSQL_USER          database username        expression          user[A-Z0-9]{3}
MYSQL_PASSWORD      database password        expression          [a-zA-Z0-9]{8}
MYSQL_DATABASE      database name                                root
----
====

The output identifies several parameters that are generated with a pseudo
regex expression generator when the template is processed.

[[using-the-instantapp-templates]]

=== Using the InstantApp Templates
OpenShift provides a number of default InstantApp templates to make it easy to
quickly get started creating a new application for different languages.
Templates are provided for Rails (Ruby), Django (Python), Node.js, CakePHP
(PHP), and Dancer (Perl). Your cluster administrator should have created these
templates in the default *openshift* project so you have access to them. If they
are not available, direct your cluster administrator to the
link:../install_config/install/first_steps.html[First Steps] topic.

By default, the templates build using a public source repository on
https://github.com[GitHub] that contains the necessary application code. In
order to be able to modify the source and build your own version of the
application, you must:

. Fork the repository referenced by the template's default
`*SOURCE_REPOSITORY_URL*` parameter.
. Override the value of the `*SOURCE_REPOSITORY_URL*` parameter when creating
from the template, specifying your fork instead of the default value.

By doing this, the build configuration created by the template will now point to
your fork of the application code, and you can modify the code and rebuild the
application at will.

[NOTE]
====
Some of the InstantApp templates define a database
link:../architecture/core_concepts/deployments.html#deployments-and-deployment-configurations[deployment
configuration]. The configuration they define uses ephemeral storage for the
database content. These templates should be used for demonstration purposes only
as all database data will be lost if the database pod restarts for any reason.
====

[[writing-templates]]
== Writing Templates
Developers can define new templates to make it easy to recreate all the resources of their application.  The template will define the resources it creates along with some metadata to guide the creation of those resources.

[[writing-description]]
=== Description
The template description covers information that informs users what your template does and helps them find it when searching in the web console.  In addition to general descriptive information, it includes a set of tags.  Useful tags include the name of the language your template is related to (e.g. 'java', 'php', 'ruby', etc).  In addition the special tag `instant-app` will cause your template to be displayed in the list of Instant Apps on the template selection page of the web console.

====
----
{
  "kind": "Template",
  "apiVersion": "v1",
  "metadata": {
    "name": "cakephp-mysql-example",<1>
    "annotations": {
      "description": "An example CakePHP application with a MySQL database",<2>
      "tags": "instant-app,php,cakephp,mysql",<3>
      "iconClass": "icon-php"<4>
    }
  }
  ...
}
----
<1> The name of the template as it will appear to users.
<2> A description of the template.
<3> Tags to be associated with the template for searching and grouping.
<4> An icon to be displayd with your template in the web console.
====

[[writing-labels]]
=== Labels
Templates can include a set of labels.  These labels will be added to each object created when the template is instantiated.  Defining a label in this way makes it easy for users to find and manage all the objects created from a particular template.

====
----
{
  "kind": "Template",
  "apiVersion": "v1",
  ...
  "labels": {
    "template": "cakephp-mysql-example"<1>
  }
  ...
}
----
<1> A label that will be applied to all objects created from this template.
====

[[writing-parameters]]
=== Parameters
Parameters allow a value to be supplied by the user or generated when the template is instantiated.  This is useful for generating random passwords or allowing the user to supply a hostname or other user specific value that is required to customize the template.  Parameters can be referenced by placing the value "${PARAMETER_NAME}" in place of any string field in the template.

====
----
{
  "kind": "Template",
  "apiVersion": "v1",
  ...
    {
      "kind": "BuildConfig",
      "apiVersion": "v1",
      "metadata": {
        "name": "cakephp-mysql-example",
        "annotations": {
          "description": "Defines how to build the application"
        }
      },
      "spec": {
        "source": {
          "type": "Git",
          "git": {
            "uri": "${SOURCE_REPOSITORY_URL}",<1>
            "ref": "${SOURCE_REPOSITORY_REF}"
          },
          "contextDir": "${CONTEXT_DIR}"
        },
      }
    }
   ...
 "parameters": [
    {
      "name": "SOURCE_REPOSITORY_URL",<2>
      "description": "The URL of the repository with your application source code",<3>
      "value": "https://github.com/openshift/cakephp-ex.git"<4>
      "required": true <5>
    },
	{
      "name": "GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET",
      "description": "A secret string used to configure the GitHub webhook",
      "generate": "expression",<6>
      "from": "[a-zA-Z0-9]{40}"<7>
    },
  ]
  ...
}
----
<1> This value will be replaced with the value of the SOURCE_REPOSITORY_URL parameter when the template is instantiated.
<2> The name of the parameter.  This value is displayed to users and used to reference the parameter within the template.
<3> A description of the parameter.
<4> A default value for the parameter which will be used if the user does not override the value when instantiating the template.
<5> Indicates this parameter is required, meaning the user cannot override it with an empty value and if the parameter does not provide a default or generated value, the user must supply a value.
<6> A parameter which has its value generated via a link:../architecture/core_concepts/templates.html#parameters[regular expression-like syntax].
<7> The input to the generator.  In this case the generator will produce a 40 character alphanumeric value including upper and lowercase characters.
====

[[writing-object-list]]
=== Object List
The main portion of the template is the list of objects which will be created when the template is instantiated.  this can be any valid api object such as a BuildConfig, DeploymentConfig, Service, etc.  The object will be created exactly as defined here, with any parameter values substituted in prior to creation.  The definition of these objects can reference parameters defined earlier.

====
----
{
  "kind": "Template",
  "apiVersion": "v1",
  ...
  "objects": [
    {
      "kind": "Service",<1>
      "apiVersion": "v1",
      "metadata": {
        "name": "cakephp-mysql-example",
        "annotations": {
          "description": "Exposes and load balances the application pods"
        }
      },
      "spec": {
        "ports": [
          {
            "name": "web",
            "port": 8080,
            "targetPort": 8080
          }
        ],
        "selector": {
          "name": "cakephp-mysql-example"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
  ...  
}

----
<1> The definition of a Service which will be created by this template.
====

[NOTE]
====
If an object definition's metadata includes a namespace field, the field will be stripped out of the definition during template instantiation.  This is necessary because all objects created during instantiation are placed into the target namespace, so it would be invalid for the object to declare a different namespace.
====

[[export-as-template]]
=== Creating a Template from Existing Resources
Rather than writing an entire template from scratch, you can also export existing resources from your project in template form, and then modify the template from there by adding parameters and other customizations.  To export resources in a project, in template form, run:

----
$ oc export all --as-template=<template_name>
----

You can also substitute a particular resource type instead of `*all*`.
