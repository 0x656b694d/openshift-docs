== Overview

A *LimitRange* object enumerates minimum/maximum resource usage values per
object in a project.

== Limits

A *LimitRange* object can enumerate the following limits for each object type
and resource value that is created or modified in the project. If a usage limit
is defined, and the incoming resource exceeds the allowed range, then the resource
is forbidden from the project.

For some fields, in the absence of a value on the incoming resource, it is possible
to apply a default value, if it is specified in the *LimitRange* document.

.Limits
[cols="3a,8a,3a,8a",options="header"]
|===

|Type |ResourceName |Description |Default Value supported

|`Container`
|`cpu`
|Minimum/maximum CPU allowed per container
|yes

|`Container`
|`memory`
|Minimum/maximum memory allowed per container
|yes

|`Pod`
|`cpu`
|Minimum/maximum CPU allowed across all containers in a pod
|no

|`Pod`
|`memory`
|Minimum/maximum memory allowed across all containers in a pod
|no

== Limit Enforcement

Once a *LimitRange* is created in a project, all resource create and modification
requests are evaluated against each *LimitRange* document in the project.
If the resource violates a minimum/maximum constraint enumerated, then the resource
is rejected. If the resource does not set an explicit value, if the constraint
supports a default value, then the default value is applied to the resource.

For example, if the container does not express a CPU resource requirement, but
the *LimitRange* specifies a default value for container CPU, then the default
value is set to the allowed CPU usage for that container, and the minimum
(if specified) is set as the minimum requested value for that container.

== Create a Limit Range

To apply a limit range to a project:

****
`$ oc create -f limit-range.json`
****

== View Limits

To view limits enforced in the project:

----
$ oc get limits
NAME
limits
$ oc describe limits limits
Name:           limits
Type            Resource        Min     Max     Default
----            --------        ---     ---     ---
Pod             memory          1Mi     1Gi     -
Pod             cpu             250m    2       -
Container       memory          1Mi     1Gi     1Mi
Container       cpu             250m    250m    250m

== Delete Limits

If you do not want to enforce limits in a project, you can remove any active
limit range by name:

****
`$ oc delete limits _<limits>_`
****
