== Overview

A project allows a community of users to organize and manage their content in
isolation from other communities.

Each project may have its own:

[horizontal]
Resources:: pods, services, replication controllers
Policies:: who can or cannot perform an action
Constraints:: quota for the project, limit pods in a project to a pool of nodes

== Create a Project

To create a new project:

****
`$ osadm new-project hello-openshift --description="This is an example project to demonstrate OpenShift v3" --display-name="Hello OpenShift" --node-selector="environment=dev"`
****

== View Projects

When you view projects, you are restricted to only seeing the projects you have
access to view based on policy.

To view projects:

****
`$ osc get projects`
****

== Switch Between Projects

You can change from the current project to a different project for CLI
operations. The specified project is then used in all subsequent operations that
manipulate project-scoped content:

****
`$ osc project _<project_name>_`
****

== Check Project Status

The `osc status` command provides a high-level overview of the current project,
with its components and their relationships. This command takes no argument:

****
`$ osc status`
****

== Delete a Project

When you delete a project, the server updates the project status to Terminating
from Active.  The server then clears all content from a project that is
Terminating before finally removing the project.  While a project is in
Terminating status, a user cannot add new content to the project.

To delete a project:

****
`$ osc delete projects hello-openshift`
****
