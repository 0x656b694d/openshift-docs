== Overview
A job, in contrast to link:../architecture/core_concepts/deployments.html#replication-controllers[Replication Controller],
is meant to run one or more pods to completion. A job tracks the overall progress
by updating its status with information about active, succeeded and failed pods.
Deleting a Job will cleanup the pods it created.

Jobs are a core Kubernetes object, `*Job*`. The
https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/docs/user-guide/jobs.md[Kubernetes documentation]
has more details on job.

== Creating a Job

A job configuration consists of the following key parts:

- A pod template which describes the application to be run.
- Optional parameter specifying how many successful pod completions is needed to
  finish a job (`*completions*`). If not specified this value defaults to `*parallelism*`.
- Optional parameter suggesting how many concurrently running pods should execute
  a job (`*parallelism*`). If not specified this value defaults to 1.

Jobs are part of the extensions Kubernetes API which can be managed with the `oc`
command like any other resource. The following is an example of a `*job*` resource:

====
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Job
metadata:
  name: pi
spec:
  selector:         <1>
    matchLabels:
      app: pi
  parallelism: 1    <2>
  completions: 1    <3>
  template:         <4>
    metadata:
      name: pi
      labels:
        app: pi
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: pi
        image: perl
        command: ["perl",  "-Mbignum=bpi", "-wle", "print bpi(2000)"]
      restartPolicy: Never
----

1. Label selector of the pod to run, it uses the https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/docs/user-guide/labels.md#label-selectors[generalized label selectors].
2. Optional parallelism, suggests how many pods a job should run concurrently, defaults to `.spec.Completions`.
3. Optional completions, informs how many successful pods completions is needed to mark a job completed, defaults to 1.
4. Template for the pod the controller creates.

== Scaling a Job

A job can be scaled up or down, which leads to changing the `*parallelism*` parameter
up or down accordingly. For example, the following command sets the aforementioned
parameter to 3.

----
$ oc scale job pi --replicas=3
