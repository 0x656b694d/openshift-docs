== Overview
You can use the CLI to copy local files to a remote directory in a container. 

== Basic Usage
Support for copying local files to a container is built into
link:../cli_reference/index.html[the CLI]:

----
$ oc rsync <local_dir> <pod>:<remote_dir> [-c <container>] 
----

For example:

====

----
$ oc rsync /home/user/source devpod1234:/src
----
====

== Requirements

The `oc rsync` command uses the local `rsync` command if present on the client's machine. This requires
that the remote container also have the `rsync` command.  If `rsync` is not found locally or in the remote 
container, then a tar archive will be created locally and sent to the container where `tar` will be used to
extract the files. If `tar` is not available in the remote container, then the copy will fail.

[NOTE]
====
On Windows clients, `oc rsync` currently only supports tar.

====

== Specifying the local directory

The first argument to the `oc rsync` command must be a local directory. Just as with UNIX rsync, if the directory
name ends in a slash ('/'), only the contents of the directory are copied to the destination. Otherwise, the directory
itself is copied to the destination with all its contents.


== Deleting files at the destination
The `--delete` flag may be used to delete any files in the remote directory that are not in the local directory.
