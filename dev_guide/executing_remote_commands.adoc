== Overview
You can use the CLI to execute remote commands in a container. This allows you
to run general Linux commands for routine operations in the container.

== Basic Usage
Support for remote container command execution is built into
link:../cli_reference/overview.html[the CLI]:

****
`$ oc exec -p _<Pod>_ [-c _<Container>_] _<Command>_ _[<Arg_1> ... <Arg_N>]_`
****

For example:

====

----
$ oc exec -p mypod date
Thu Apr  9 02:21:53 UTC 2015
----
====

== Protocol
Clients initiate the execution of a remote command in a container by issuing a
request to the Kubernetes API server:

****
`/proxy/minions/_<Node_Name>_/exec/_<Namespace>_/_<Pod>_/_<Container>_?command=_<Command>_`
****

In the above URL:

- `_Node_Name_` is the FQDN of the node.
- `_Namespace_` is the namespace of the target pod.
- `_Pod_` is the name of the target pod.
- `_Container_` is the name of the target container.
- `_Command_` is the desired command to be executed.

For example:

====

[options="nowrap"]
----
/proxy/minions/node123.openshift.com/exec/myns/mypod/mycontainer?command=date
----
====

Additionally, the client can add parameters to the request to indicate if:

- the client should send input to the remote container's command (stdin).
- the client's terminal is a TTY.
- the remote container's command should send output from stdout to the client.
- the remote container's command should send output from stderr to the client.

After sending an `exec` request to the API server, the client upgrades the
connection to one that supports multiplexed streams; the current implementation
uses *SPDY*.

The client creates one stream each for stdin, stdout, and stderr. To distinguish among the streams, the client sets the `streamType` header on the stream to one of `stdin`, `stdout`, or `stderr`.

The client closes all streams, the upgraded connection, and the underlying connection when it is finished with the remote command execution request.

guide for more information.
