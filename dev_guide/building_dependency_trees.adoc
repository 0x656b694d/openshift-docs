== Overview
OpenShift includes an experimental command-line tool called *build-chain*. This
tool builds a dependency tree to identify which
link:../architecture/core_concepts/containers_and_images.html#docker-images[images]
would be  affected by updating an image in a specified
link:../architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.html#image-streams[image
stream].

OpenShift uses image change triggers (in the
link:../dev_guide/builds.html#defining-a-buildconfig[BuildConfig]) to detect
when an image stream tag has been updated. The *build-chain* tool then
determines which
link:../architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.html#builds[builds]
to trigger; it analyzes the output of those builds to determine if they will in
turn update another image stream tag. If they do, the tool continues to follow
the dependency tree. Lastly, it outputs a graph specifying the image stream tags
that would be impacted by an update to the top-level tag. The default output
syntax for this tool is set to JSON, but DOT and AST are also available.

== Usage

The following table describes common *build-chain* usage and general syntax:

[cols=".^5,.^5",options="header"]
|===

|Description |Syntax

|Build a dependency tree for the specified image stream with the specified tag in the current namespace and output it in JSON.
|`openshift ex build-chain _<image-stream>:<tag>_`

|Build and output a dependency tree for the specified image stream with the 'latest' tag in 'testing' namespace using DOT syntax.
|`openshift ex build-chain _<image-stream>_ -o dot -n testing`

|Build dependency trees for all tags in the specified image stream.
|`openshift ex build-chain _<image-stream>_ --all-tags`

|Build dependency trees for all tags of all image streams in the current namespace and output them in JSON.
|`openshift ex build-chain`

|Build dependency trees for all tags of all image streams across all namespaces and output them using AST syntax.
|`openshift ex build-chain --all -o ast`
|===

== Output

The default output of *build-chain* is set to JSON, but DOT and AST are also supported. AST is helpful for debugging, whereas DOT can help to visualize the output of *build-chain* by using the *dot* utility from the GraphViz library.

----
$ openshift ex build-chain <image-stream>:<tag> -o dot > tree.dot
----

----
$ dot -Tps tree.dot -o tree.ps
----

The DOT output from the build-chain utility gets parsed with the DOT parser. If the *build-chain* tool completes successfully (barring any invalid build configurations) then you should see the dependency tree visualized in `tree.ps`.
