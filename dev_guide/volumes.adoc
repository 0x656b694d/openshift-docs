== Overview

A *PersistentVolume* object is a storage resource in an OpenShift cluster.  It is provisioned by an administrator
and made available to users who lay claims to the resource.

A *PersistentVolumeClaim* object is a request for storage resources by a pod author.  The claim is paired with a
volume that generally matches the user's request.

== Volume Provisioning

Storage is provisioned by an administrator by creating *PersistentVolume* objects from sources such as GCE Persistent Disks,
AWS Elastic Block Stores, and NFS mounts.

== Sample persistent volume file

== Requesting Storage

Pod authors request storage by creating *PersistentVolumeClaim* objects in their projects.

== Sample persistent volume claim file

        "name": "claim1"

        "accessModes": [ "ReadWriteOnce" ],
        "resources": {
            "requests": {
                "storage": "5Gi"
            }
        }

== Volume and Claim Binding

A *PersistentVolume* is a specific resource.  A *PersistentVolumeClaim* is a request for a resource with specific attributes, such as storage size.
In between the two is a process that matches a claim to an available volume and binds them together.  This allows the claim to be used
as a volume in a pod.  OpenShift finds the volume backing the claim and mounts it into the pod.

You can tell whether a claim or volume is bound by querying the CLI:

----
$ osc get pvc
NAME        LABELS    STATUS    VOLUME
claim1      map[]     Bound     pv0001

$ osc get pv
NAME                LABELS              CAPACITY            ACCESSMODES         STATUS    CLAIM
pv0001              map[]               5368709120          RWO                 Bound     yournamespace / claim1
----

== Claims as Volumes in Pods

A *PersistentVolumeClaim* is used by a pod as a volume.  OpenShift will find the claim with the given name in the same namespace as the pod, then use the claim
to find the corresponding volume to mount.
