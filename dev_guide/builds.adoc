== Overview
A link:../architecture/core_objects/builds.html[build] is a process of creating
runnable images to be used on OpenShift. There are three types of builds:

- Docker build
- STI build
- custom build

== Starting a Build
You can manually invoke a build using the following command:

****
`$ oc start-build _<buildConfigID>_`
****

A build can be re-run using the `--from-build` flag:

****
`$ oc start-build --from-build=_<buildID>_`
****

Specify the `--follow` flag to stream the build's logs in stdout:

****
`$ oc start-build _<buildConfigID>_ --follow`
****

== Canceling a Build
You can manually cancel a build using the following command:

****
`$ oc cancel-build _<buildID>_`
****

== Accessing Build Logs
To allow access to build logs, use the following command:

****
`$ oc build-logs _<buildID>_`
****

*STI Build Logs*

link:../architecture/core_objects/builds.html#sti-build[STI builds] by default
show full output of the *_assemble_* script and all subsequent errors.
To enable more verbose output, you can pass the `*BUILD_LOGLEVEL*`
environment variable as part of the `*sourceStrategy*` in BuildConfig:

====

----
        {
          "sourceStrategy": {
            ...
            "env": [
              {
                "Name": "BUILD_LOGLEVEL",
                "Value": "2" <1>
              }
            ]
          }
        }
----

<1> Adjust this value to the desired log level.
====

NOTE: A platform administrator can set verbosity for the entire OpenShift
instance by passing the `--loglevel` option to the `openshift start` command.
If both `--loglevel` and `BUILD_LOGLEVEL` are specified, `BUILD_LOGLEVEL` takes precedence.

Available log levels for STI are as follows:

[horizontal]
Level 0:: Produces output from containers running the *_assemble_* script and all encountered errors.  This is the default.
Level 1:: Produces basic information about the executed process.
Level 2:: Produces very detailed information about the executed process.
Level 3:: Produces very detailed information about the executed process, and a listing of the archive contents.

== Source Code
The source code location is one of the required parameters for the
`*BuildConfig*`. The build uses this location and fetches the source code that
is later built. The source code location definition is part of the
`*parameters*` section in the `*BuildConfig*`:

====

----
        {
          "source" : {
            "type" : "Git", <1>
            "git" : { <2>
              "uri": "git://github.com/openshift/ruby-hello-world.git"
            },
            "contextDir": "app/dir", <3>
          },
        }
----

<1> The `*type*` field describes what SCM is used to fetch your source code.
<2> In this example, the `*git*` field contains the URI to the remote Git
repository where your source code lives. It might optionally specify the `*ref*`
field if you want to check out a specific Git reference. A valid `*ref*` can be
a SHA1 tag or a branch name.
<3> The `*contextDir*` field allows you to override the default location inside
the source code repository, where the build looks for the application source
code. If your application exists inside a sub-directory, you can override the
default location (the root folder) using this field.

== STI Environment

There are two ways to make environment variables available to the link:../architecture/core_objects/builds.html#sti-build[STI] 
build process and resulting image, Environment files and BuildConfig environment values.  

=== Environment files
STI enables you to set environment values
in your application by specifying them in a *_.sti/environment_* file in the
source repository. The environment variables are then present during the build
process and in the final docker image. The complete list of supported
environment variables are available in the documentation for each image.

If you provide a *_.sti/environment_* file in your source repository, STI reads
this file during the build. This allows customization of the build behavior as
the *_assemble_* script may use these variables.

For example, if you want to disable assets compilation for your Rails
application, you can add `*DISABLE_ASSET_COMPILATION=true*` in the
*_.sti/environment_* file to cause assets compilation to be skipped during the
build.

In addition to builds, the specified environment variables are also available in
the running application itself. For example, you can add
`*RAILS_ENV=development*` in the *_.sti/environment_* file to cause the Rails
application to be started in `development` mode instead of `production`.

=== BuildConfig Environment
You can add environment variables to the SourceStrategy definition of the BuildConfig.  
Environment variables defined here will be visible during the *_assemble_* script
execution and will be defined in the output image, making them also available to
the *_run_* script and application code.

== Build Triggers
When defining a `*BuildConfig*`, you can define triggers to control the
circumstances in which a build should be run for the `*BuildConfig*`. There are two
types of triggers available:

* Webhook
* Image change

=== Webhook Triggers
Webhook triggers allow you to trigger a new build by sending a request to the
OpenShift API endpoint. You can define these triggers using
https://developer.github.com/webhooks/[GitHub webhooks] or generic webhooks.

*GitHub Webhooks*

https://developer.github.com/webhooks/creating/[GitHub webhooks] can handle the
call made by GitHub when a repository is updated. When defining the trigger, you
can specify a *secret* as part of the URL you supply to GitHub when
configuring the webhook. The *secret* ensures that only you and your
repository can trigger the build. The following example is a trigger definition
JSON within the `*BuildConfig*`:

====

----
        {
          "type": "github",
          "github": {
            "secret": "secret101"
          }
        }
----
====

The payload URL is returned as the GitHub Webhook URL by the `describe` command
(see link:#describe-buildconfig[below]), and is structured as follows:

****
`http://_<openshift_api_host:port>_/osapi/v1beta1/buildConfigHooks/_<build-name>_/_<secret>_/github?namespace=_<namespace>_`
****

*Generic Webhooks*

Generic webhooks can be invoked from any system capable of making a web
request. As with a GitHub webhook, you specify a *secret* when defining the
trigger, and the caller must provide this *secret* to trigger the build. The
following is an example trigger definition JSON within the `*BuildConfig*`:

====

----
        {
          "type": "generic",
          "generic": {
            "secret": "secret101"
          }
        }
----
====

To set up the caller, supply the calling system with the URL of the generic
webhook endpoint for your build:

****
`http://_<openshift_api_host:port>_/osapi/v1beta1/buildConfigHooks/_<build-name>_/_<secret>_/generic?namespace=_<namespace>_`
****

The endpoint can accept an optional payload with the following format:

====

----
{
     type: 'git',
     git: {
        uri: '<url to git repository>',
	ref: '<optional git reference>',
	commit: '<commit hash identifying a specific git commit>',
	author: {
		name: '<author name>',
		email: '<author e-mail>',
	},
	committer: {
		name: '<committer name>',
		email: '<committer e-mail>',
	},
	message: '<commit message>'
     }
}
----
====

[#describe-buildconfig]
*Displaying a BuildConfig's Webhook URLs*

Use the following command to display the webhook URLs associated with a build
configuration:

****
`oc describe buildConfig _<name>_`
****

If the above command does not display any webhook URLs, then no webhook trigger
is defined for that build configuration.

=== Image Change Triggers
Image change triggers allow your build to be automatically invoked when a new
version of an upstream image is available. For example, if a build is based on
top of a RHEL image, then you can trigger that build to run anytime the RHEL
image changes. As a result, the application image is always running on the
latest RHEL base image.

Configuring an image change trigger requires the following actions:

1. Define an `*ImageStream*` that points to the upstream image you want to
trigger on:
+
====

----
    {
      "metadata":{
        "name": "ruby-20-centos7",
      },
      "kind": "ImageStream",
      "apiVersion": "v1beta1",
    }
----
====
+
This defines the image stream that is tied to a Docker image repository
located at `_<system-registry>_/_<namespace>_/ruby-20-centos7`. The
`_<system-registry>_` is defined as a service with the name `docker-registry`
running in OpenShift.

2. Define a build with a strategy that consumes the image stream; for
example:
+
====

----
    "strategy": {
      "type": "Source",
      "sourceStrategy": {
        "from": {
          "kind": "ImageStreamTag",
          "name": "ruby-20-centos7:latest"
        },        
      }
    }
----
====
+
In this case, the Source strategy definition is consuming the `latest` tag of the
ImageStream named `ruby-20-centos7` located within this namespace.

3. Define an image change trigger:
+
====

----
    {
      "type": "imageChange",
      "imageChange": {}
    }
----
====
+
This defines an image change trigger which monitors `*ImageStream*` and `*Tag*` defined
by the Strategy's From field.  When a change occurs, a new build is triggered
and is supplied with an immutable Docker tag that points to the new image that
was just created.  This new image will be used by the Strategy when it executes
for the build.  For example, the resulting build will be:

====

----
    "strategy": {
      "type": "Source",
      "sourceStrategy": {
        "from": {
          "kind": "DockerImage",
          "name": "172.30.17.3:5001/mynamespace/ruby-20-centos7:immutableid"
        }
      }
    }
----
====

This ensures that the triggered build uses the new image that was just pushed to
the repository, and the build can be re-run anytime with exactly the same
inputs.

In addition to setting the image field for all `*Strategy*` types, for custom builds, 
the `OPENSHIFT_CUSTOM_BUILD_BASE_IMAGE` environment variable is checked. If it does 
not exist, then it is created with the immutable image reference. If it does exist 
then it is updated with the immutable image reference.

If a build is triggered due to a webhook trigger or manual request,
the build that is created uses the `*immutableid*` resolved from the
`*ImageStream*` referenced by the `*Strategy*`.  This ensures that builds
are performed using consistent image tags for ease of reproduction.
