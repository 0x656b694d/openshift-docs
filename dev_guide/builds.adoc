== Overview
A link:../architecture/core_objects/builds.html[build] is a process of creating
runnable images to be used on OpenShift. There are three build strategies:

- link:../architecture/core_objects/builds.html#source-build[Source-To-Image]
- link:../architecture/core_objects/builds.html#docker-build[Docker]
- link:../architecture/core_objects/builds.html#custom-build[Custom]

== Defining a buildConfig

A `*buildConfig*` describes a single build definition and a
set of link:#triggers[triggers] for when a new build should be created.

A buildConfig is a REST object, which can be used in a POST to the API server to
create a new instance. The following configuration results in a new build
every time a Docker image tag or the source code changes:

====

[source,json]
----
{
  "kind": "BuildConfig",
    "apiVersion": "v1",
    "metadata": {
      "name": "ruby-sample-build", <1>
    },
  "spec": {
    "triggers": [ <2>
      {
        "type": "Github",
        "github": {
          "secret": "secret101"
        }
      },
      {
        "type": "Generic",
        "generic": {
          "secret": "secret101"
        }
      },
      {
        "type": "ImageChange"
      }
    ],
    "source": { <3>
      "type": "Git",
      "git": {
        "uri": "git://github.com/openshift/ruby-hello-world.git"
      }
    },
    "strategy": { <4>
      "type": "Source",
      "sourceStrategy": {
        "from": {
          "kind": "ImageStreamTag",
          "name": "ruby-20-centos7:latest"
        }
      }
    },
    "output": { <5>
      "to": {
        "kind": "ImageStreamTag",
        "name": "origin-ruby-sample:latest"
      }
    },
  },
}
----

<1> This specification will create a new buildConfig named ruby-sample-build.
<2> You can specify a list of triggers, which causes a new build to be created.
The `*ImageChange*` trigger creates a new build each time the Docker image specified in the `*strategy.from*` field changes. The `*github*`  and `*generic*` triggers starts the build when a callback is made from the GitHub or other source code repository hosting service, indicating  change in the source code specified in `*source*` section.
<3> The `*source*` section defines the source code repository location. You can provide additional options, such as `*sourceSecret*` or `*contextDir*` here.
<4> The `*strategy*` section describes the build strategy used to execute the build. You can specify `*Source*`, `*Docker*` and `*Custom*` strategies here. This specification uses the `*ruby-20-centos7*` Docker image that Source-To-Image will use for the application build.
<5> After the Docker image is successfully built, it will be pushed into the repository described in the `*output*` section.
====

== Defining an incremental buildConfig
Source-To-Image (S2I) builds provide an option to perform incremental build, which means they will
reuse artifacts from previously built image. To create an incremental build one
needs to create a BuildConfig as previously explained, but with a slight modification
in strategy definition as presented below:

====

[source,json]
----
{
  "strategy": {
    "type": "Source",
    "sourceStrategy": {
      "from": {
        "kind": "ImageStreamTag",
        "name": "incremental-image:latest" <1>
      },
      "incremental": true <2>
    }
  }
}
----

<1> You need to specify here an image that supports incremental builds. Note: the S2I images provided by OpenShift do not implement artifact reuse, so setting incremental to true will have no effect on BuildConfigs using those builder images.
<2> This flag controls whether an incremental build is attempted. If the builder image does not support incremental builds, the build will still succeed but you will get a log message that the incremental build was not successful because of a missing `save-artifacts` script.
====

NOTE: For information on how to create a builder image which supports incremental build see link:../creating_images/sti.html[creating images guide].

== Starting a Build
You can manually invoke a build using the following command:

****
`$ oc start-build _<buildConfigID>_`
****

A build can be re-run using the `--from-build` flag:

****
`$ oc start-build --from-build=_<buildID>_`
****

Specify the `--follow` flag to stream the build's logs in stdout:

****
`$ oc start-build _<buildConfigID>_ --follow`
****

== Canceling a Build
You can manually cancel a build using the following command:

****
`$ oc cancel-build _<buildID>_`
****

== Accessing Build Logs
To allow access to build logs, use the following command:

****
`$ oc build-logs _<buildID>_`
****

*Source Build Logs*

link:../architecture/core_objects/builds.html#source-build[Source builds] by default
show full output of the *_assemble_* script and all subsequent errors.
To enable more verbose output, you can pass the `*BUILD_LOGLEVEL*`
environment variable as part of the `*sourceStrategy*` in BuildConfig:

====

----
{
  "sourceStrategy": {
    ...
    "env": [
      {
        "Name": "BUILD_LOGLEVEL",
        "Value": "2" <1>
      }
    ]
  }
}
----

<1> Adjust this value to the desired log level.
====

NOTE: A platform administrator can set verbosity for the entire OpenShift
instance by passing the `--loglevel` option to the `openshift start` command.
If both `--loglevel` and `BUILD_LOGLEVEL` are specified, `BUILD_LOGLEVEL` takes precedence.

Available log levels for Source builds are as follows:

[horizontal]
Level 0:: Produces output from containers running the *_assemble_* script and all encountered errors.  This is the default.
Level 1:: Produces basic information about the executed process.
Level 2:: Produces very detailed information about the executed process.
Level 3:: Produces very detailed information about the executed process, and a listing of the archive contents.

== Source Code
The source code location is one of the required parameters for the
`*BuildConfig*`. The build uses this location and fetches the source code that
is later built. The source code location definition is part of the
`*parameters*` section in the `*BuildConfig*`:

====

----
{
  "source" : {
    "type" : "Git", <1>
    "git" : { <2>
      "uri": "git://github.com/openshift/ruby-hello-world.git"
    },
    "contextDir": "app/dir", <3>
  },
}
----

<1> The `*type*` field describes what SCM is used to fetch your source code.
<2> In this example, the `*git*` field contains the URI to the remote Git
repository where your source code lives. It might optionally specify the `*ref*`
field if you want to check out a specific Git reference. A valid `*ref*` can be
a SHA1 tag or a branch name.
<3> The `*contextDir*` field allows you to override the default location inside
the source code repository, where the build looks for the application source
code. If your application exists inside a sub-directory, you can override the
default location (the root folder) using this field.
====

[[configuring-the-source-environment]]
== Source Environment

There are two ways to make environment variables available to the link:../architecture/core_objects/builds.html#source-build[Source]
build process and resulting image, Environment files and BuildConfig environment values.

=== Environment files
Source enables you to set environment values
in your application by specifying them in a *_.sti/environment_* file in the
source repository. The environment variables are then present during the build
process and in the final docker image. The complete list of supported
environment variables are available in the documentation for each image.

If you provide a *_.sti/environment_* file in your source repository, S2I reads
this file during the build. This allows customization of the build behavior as
the *_assemble_* script may use these variables.

For example, if you want to disable assets compilation for your Rails
application, you can add `*DISABLE_ASSET_COMPILATION=true*` in the
*_.sti/environment_* file to cause assets compilation to be skipped during the
build.

In addition to builds, the specified environment variables are also available in
the running application itself. For example, you can add
`*RAILS_ENV=development*` in the *_.sti/environment_* file to cause the Rails
application to be started in `development` mode instead of `production`.

=== BuildConfig Environment
You can add environment variables to the SourceStrategy definition of the BuildConfig.
Environment variables defined here will be visible during the *_assemble_* script
execution and will be defined in the output image, making them also available to
the *_run_* script and application code.

== Build Triggers
When defining a `*BuildConfig*`, you can define triggers to control the
circumstances in which a build should be run for the `*BuildConfig*`. There are two
types of triggers available:

* Webhook
* Image change

=== Webhook Triggers
Webhook triggers allow you to trigger a new build by sending a request to the
OpenShift API endpoint. You can define these triggers using
https://developer.github.com/webhooks/[GitHub webhooks] or generic webhooks.

*GitHub Webhooks*

https://developer.github.com/webhooks/creating/[GitHub webhooks] can handle the
call made by GitHub when a repository is updated. When defining the trigger, you
must specify a *secret* as part of the URL you supply to GitHub when
configuring the webhook. The *secret* ensures that only you and your
repository can trigger the build. The following example is a trigger definition
JSON within the `*BuildConfig*`:

====

----
{
  "type": "github",
  "github": {
    "secret": "secret101"
  }
}
----
====

The payload URL is returned as the GitHub Webhook URL by the `describe` command
(see link:#describe-buildconfig[below]), and is structured as follows:

****
`http://_<openshift_api_host:port>_/osapi/v1/namespaces/_<namespace>_/buildconfigs/_<name>_/webhooks/_<secret>_/github`
****

*Generic Webhooks*

Generic webhooks can be invoked from any system capable of making a web
request. As with a GitHub webhook, you must specify a *secret* when defining the
trigger, and the caller must provide this *secret* to trigger the build. The
following is an example trigger definition JSON within the `*BuildConfig*`:

====

----
{
  "type": "generic",
  "generic": {
    "secret": "secret101"
  }
}
----
====

To set up the caller, supply the calling system with the URL of the generic
webhook endpoint for your build:

****
`http://_<openshift_api_host:port>_/osapi/v1/namespaces/_<namespace>_/buildconfigs/_<name>_/webhooks/_<secret>_/generic`
****

The endpoint can accept an optional payload with the following format:

====

----
{
  type: 'git',
  git: {
    uri: '<url to git repository>',
    ref: '<optional git reference>',
    commit: '<commit hash identifying a specific git commit>',
    author: {
      name: '<author name>',
      email: '<author e-mail>',
    },
    committer: {
      name: '<committer name>',
      email: '<committer e-mail>',
    },
    message: '<commit message>'
  }
}
----
====

[#describe-buildconfig]
*Displaying a BuildConfig's Webhook URLs*

Use the following command to display the webhook URLs associated with a build
configuration:

****
`oc describe buildConfig _<name>_`
****

If the above command does not display any webhook URLs, then no webhook trigger
is defined for that build configuration.

=== Image Change Triggers
Image change triggers allow your build to be automatically invoked when a new
version of an upstream image is available. For example, if a build is based on
top of a RHEL image, then you can trigger that build to run anytime the RHEL
image changes. As a result, the application image is always running on the
latest RHEL base image.

Configuring an image change trigger requires the following actions:

1. Define an `*ImageStream*` that points to the upstream image you want to
trigger on:
+
====

----
{
  "kind": "ImageStream",
  "apiVersion": "v1",
  "metadata": {
    "name": "ruby-20-centos7"
  }
}
----
====
+
This defines the image stream that is tied to a Docker image repository
located at `_<system-registry>_/_<namespace>_/ruby-20-centos7`. The
`_<system-registry>_` is defined as a service with the name `docker-registry`
running in OpenShift.

2. Define a build with a strategy that consumes the image stream; for
example:
+
====

----
{
  "strategy": {
    "type": "Source",
    "sourceStrategy": {
      "from": {
        "kind": "ImageStreamTag",
        "name": "ruby-20-centos7:latest"
      },
    }
  }
}
----
====
+
In this case, the Source strategy definition is consuming the `latest` tag of the
ImageStream named `ruby-20-centos7` located within this namespace.

3. Define an image change trigger:
+
====

----
{
  "type": "imageChange",
  "imageChange": {}
}
----
====
+
This defines an image change trigger which monitors `*ImageStream*` and `*Tag*` defined
by the Strategy's From field.  When a change occurs, a new build is triggered
and is supplied with an immutable Docker tag that points to the new image that
was just created.  This new image will be used by the Strategy when it executes
for the build.  For example, the resulting build will be:

====

----
{
  "strategy": {
    "type": "Source",
    "sourceStrategy": {
      "from": {
        "kind": "DockerImage",
        "name": "172.30.17.3:5001/mynamespace/ruby-20-centos7:immutableid"
      }
    }
  }
}
----
====

This ensures that the triggered build uses the new image that was just pushed to
the repository, and the build can be re-run anytime with exactly the same
inputs.

In addition to setting the image field for all `*Strategy*` types, for custom builds,
the `OPENSHIFT_CUSTOM_BUILD_BASE_IMAGE` environment variable is checked. If it does
not exist, then it is created with the immutable image reference. If it does exist
then it is updated with the immutable image reference.

If a build is triggered due to a webhook trigger or manual request,
the build that is created uses the `*immutableid*` resolved from the
`*ImageStream*` referenced by the `*Strategy*`.  This ensures that builds
are performed using consistent image tags for ease of reproduction.

[#using-docker-credentials-for-pushing-and-pulling-images]
== Using Docker Credentials for Pushing and Pulling Images

Supply the `.dockercfg` file with valid Docker Registry credentials in order to push the output image into a private Docker Registry or pull the
builder image from the private Docker Registry that requires authentication.
For the OpenShift Docker Registry, you don't have to do this because the Secrets
are generated automatically for you by OpenShift.

The *_.dockercfg_* JSON file exists in your home directory by default and has
following format:

====

----
{
	"https://index.docker.io/v1/": { <1>
		"auth": "YWRfbGzhcGU6R2labnRib21ifTE=", <2>
		"email": "user@example.com" <3>
	}
}
----

<1> URL of the registry.
<2> Encrypted password.
<3> Email address for the login.
====

You can define multiple Docker registry entries in this file. Alternatively, you
can also add authentication entries to this file by running the `docker login`
command. The file will be created if it does not exist.

Kubernetes provides the https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes/blob/master/docs/design/secrets.md[Secret]
resource, which is used to store your configuration and passwords.

To create the `*Secret*` resource from your local `.dockercfg` file, you can run
following command:

====
----
$ openshift ex bundle-secret dockerhub ~/.dockercfg | oc create -f -
----
====

This command generates JSON specification of the Secret resource named
'dockerhub'. Then this resource is passed to the standard input of `*oc create*`
command.

Once you have the `*Secret*` created, you can add a `PushSecret` field into the
`Output` section of the `BuildConfig` and set it to the name of the `*Secret*`
that you created, which in the above example is `*dockerhub*`:

====

----
{
  "parameters": {
    "output": {
      "to": {
        "name": "private-image"
      },
      "pushSecret":{
        "name":"dockerhub"
      }
    }
  }
}
----
====

Pull the builder Docker image from a private Docker registry by specifying the
`PullSecret` field, which is part of the build strategy definition:

====

----
{
  "strategy": {
    "sourceStrategy": {
      "from": {
        "kind": "DockerImage",
        "name": "docker.io/user/private_repository"
       },
       "pullSecret": {
        "name": "dockerhub"
       },
    },
    "type": "Source"
  }
}
----
====

[#using-private-repositories-for-builds]
== Using Private Repositories for Builds

Supply valid credentials to build an application from a private repository.
Currently, only SSH key based authentication is supported. The repository keys
are located in the `$HOME/.ssh/` directory, and are named `id_dsa.pub`,
`id_ecdsa.pub`, `id_ed25519.pub` or `id_rsa.pub` by default. Generate SSH key
credentials with the following command:

====

----
$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "your_email@example.com"
----
====

Two files will be created: the public key (as explained above) and a
corresponding private key (one of `id_dsa`, `id_ecdsa`, `id_ed25519` or
`id_rsa`). With both of these in place you should consult your source control
management (SCM) system's manual on how to upload the public key. The private
key will be used to access your private repository.

The
https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes/blob/master/docs/design/secrets.md[Secret]
resource is used to store your keys. Create the `*Secret*` first before using
the SSH key to access the private repository. The `*data*` field for the
`*Secret*` object must contain your private key with the value set to the
base64-encoded content of that file:

====

----
$ base64 -w 0 $HOME/.ssh/id_rsa
6yJodHRwc1ovL2zuZGV4LmRvY21lci5aby92MS8iOnsiYXV0aCI6ImJXWnZhblJwYXpwdVoybGxkR2d4TUE9PSIsImVtYWlsIj8ibWlAbWlmby5zayJ9fQ==
----
====

Copy the value returned from the above command and place it into the
`ssh-privatekey` field in `*_secret.json_*` file:

====

----
{
  "kind": "Secret",
  "apiVersion": "v1",
  "metadata": {
    "name": "scmsecret"
  },
  "data": {
    "ssh-privatekey": "6yJodHRwc1ovL2zuZGV4LmRvY21lci5aby92MS8iOnsiYXV0aCI6ImJXWnZhblJwYXpwdVoybGxkR2d4TUE9PSIsImVtYWlsIj8ibWlAbWlmby5zayJ9fQ=="
  },
  "type": "Opaque"
}
----
====

Then, create the `*Secret*` from the *_secret.json_* file using the following
command:

====

----
$ oc create -f secret.json
----
====

Add a `SourceSecret` field into the `Source` section inside the `BuildConfig`
and set it to the name of the `*Secret*` that you created, in this case
`*scmsecret*`:

====

----
{
  "apiVersion": "v1",
  "kind": "BuildConfig",
  "metadata": {
    "name": "sample-build",
  },
  "parameters": {
    "output": {
      "to": {
        "name": "sample-image"
      }
    },
    "source": {
      "git": {
        "uri": "git@repository.com:user/app.git"
      },
      "sourceSecret": {
        "name": "scmsecret"
      },
      "type": "Git"
    },
    "strategy": {
      "sourceStrategy": {
        "from": {
          "kind": "ImageStreamTag",
          "name": "python-33-centos7:latest"
        }
      },
      "type": "Source"
    }
  }
----
====

[NOTE]
====
The URL of private repository is usually in the form `git@example.com:username/repository`
====
