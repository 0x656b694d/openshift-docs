== Overview
A link:../architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.html#builds[build] is a process of creating
runnable images to be used on OpenShift. There are three build strategies:

- link:../architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.html#source-build[Source-To-Image (S2I)]
- link:../architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.html#docker-build[Docker]
- link:../architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.html#custom-build[Custom]

[[defining-a-buildconfig]]

== Defining a buildConfig

A build configuration describes a single build definition and a set of
link:#triggers[triggers] for when a new build should be created.

A build configuration is defined by a `*buildConfig*`, which is a REST object
that can be used in a POST to the API server to create a new instance. The
following example `*buildConfig*` results in a new build every time a Docker
image tag or the source code changes:

.BuildConfig Object Definition

        "generic": {
          "secret": "secret101"
        }
      },
      {
        "type": "ImageChange"
      }
    ],
    "source": { <3>
      "type": "Git",
      "git": {
        "uri": "git://github.com/openshift/ruby-hello-world.git"
      }
    },
    "strategy": { <4>
      "type": "Source",
      "sourceStrategy": {
        "from": {
          "kind": "ImageStreamTag",
          "name": "ruby-20-centos7:latest"

        "name": "origin-ruby-sample:latest"
      }
    },
  },
}
----

<1> This specification will create a new `*buildConfig*` named
*ruby-sample-build*.
<2> You can specify a list of link:#build-triggers[triggers], which cause a new
build to be created.
<3> The `*source*` section defines the source code repository location. You can
provide additional options, such as `*sourceSecret*` or `*contextDir*` here.
<4> The `*strategy*` section describes the build strategy used to execute the
build. You can specify `*Source*`, `*Docker*` and `*Custom*` strategies here.
This above example uses the `*ruby-20-centos7*` Docker image that
Source-To-Image will use for the application build.
<5> After the Docker image is successfully built, it will be pushed into the
repository described in the `*output*` section.
====

[[source-to-image-strategy-options]]

== Source-to-Image Strategy Options

The following options are specific to the
link:../architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.html#source-build[S2I
build strategy].

[[s2i-force-pull]]

=== Force Pull

By default, if the builder image specified in the build configuration is
available locally on the node, that image will be used. However, to override the
local image and refresh it from the registry to which the image stream points,
create a `*buildConfig*` with the `*forcePull*` flag set to *true*:

====

[source,json]
----
{
  "strategy": {
    "type": "Source",
    "sourceStrategy": {
      "from": {
        "kind": "ImageStreamTag",
        "name": "builder-image:latest" <1>
      },
      "forcePull": true <2>
    }
  }
}
----

<1> The builder image being used, where the local version on the node may not be
up to date with the version in the registry to which the image stream points.
<2> This flag causes the local builder image to be ignored and a fresh version
to be pulled from the registry to which the image stream points. Setting
`*forcePull*` to *false* results in the default behavior of honoring the image
stored locally.
====

[[incremental-builds]]

=== Incremental Builds

S2I can perform incremental builds, which means it reuses artifacts from
previously-built images. To create an incremental build, create a
`*buildConfig*` with the following modification to the strategy definition:

====

[source,json]
----
{
  "strategy": {
    "type": "Source",
    "sourceStrategy": {
      "from": {
        "kind": "ImageStreamTag",
        "name": "incremental-image:latest" <1>
      },
      "incremental": true <2>
    }
  }
}
----

<1> Specify an image that supports incremental builds. The S2I images provided
by OpenShift do not implement artifact reuse, so setting `*incremental*`  to
*true* will have no effect on builds using those builder images.
<2> This flag controls whether an incremental build is attempted. If the builder
image does not support incremental builds, the build will still succeed, but you
will get a log message stating the incremental build was not successful because
of a missing *_save-artifacts_* script.
====

[NOTE]
====
See the link:../creating_images/s2i.html[S2I Requirements] topic for information
on how to create a builder image supporting incremental builds.
====

[[override-builder-image-scripts]]

=== Override Builder Image Scripts

You can override the *_assemble_*, *_run_*, and *_save-artifacts_*
link:../creating_images/s2i.html#s2i-scripts[S2I scripts] provided by the
builder image in one of two ways. Either:

1. Provide an *_assemble_*, *_run_*, and/or *_save-artifacts_* script in the
*_.sti/bin_* directory of your application source repository, or

2. Provide a URL of a directory containing the scripts as part of the strategy
definition. For example:

====

[source,json]
----
{
  "strategy": {
    "type": "Source",
    "sourceStrategy": {
      "from": {
        "kind": "ImageStreamTag",
        "name": "builder-image:latest"
      },
      "scripts": "http://somehost.com/scripts_directory" <1>
    }
  }
}
----

<1> This path will have *_run_*, *_assemble_*, and *_save-artifacts_* appended
to it. If any or all scripts are found they will be used in place of the same
named script(s) provided in the image.
====

[NOTE]
====
Files located at the `*scripts*` URL take precedence over files located in
*_.sti/bin_* of the source repository. See the
link:../creating_images/s2i.html[S2I Requirements] topic and the
link:https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image/blob/master/docs/builder_image.md#sti-scripts[S2I
documentation] for information on how S2I scripts are used.
====

[[docker-strategy-options]]

== Docker Strategy Options

The following options are specific to the
link:../architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.html#docker-build[Docker
build strategy].

[[no-cache]]

=== No Cache

Docker builds normally reuse cached layers found on the host performing the
build. Setting the `*nocache*` option to *true* forces the build to ignore
cached layers and rerun all steps of the *_Dockerfile_*:

====

[source,json]
----
{
  "strategy": {
    "type": "Docker",
    "dockerStrategy": {
      "nocache": true
    }
  }
}
----
====

[[docker-force-pull]]

=== Force Pull

By default, if the builder image specified in the build configuration is
available locally on the node, that image will be used. However, to override the
local image and refresh it from the registry to which the image stream points,
create a `*buildConfig*` with the `*forcePull*` flag set to *true*:

====

[source,json]
----
{
  "strategy": {
    "type": "Docker",
    "dockerStrategy": {
      "forcePull": true <1>
    }
  }
}
----

<1> This flag causes the local builder image to be ignored, and a fresh version
to be pulled from the registry to which the image stream points. Setting
`*forcePull*` to *false* results in the default behavior of honoring the image
stored locally.
====

[[using-a-proxy-for-git-cloning]]

== Using a Proxy for Git Cloning
If your Git repository can only be accessed using a proxy, you can define the
proxy to use in the `*source*` section of the `*BuildConfig*`. You can configure
both a HTTP and HTTPS proxy to use. Both fields are optional.

[NOTE]
====
Your source URI must use the HTTP or HTTPS protocol for this to work.
====

====

[source,json]
----
"source": {
  "type": "Git",
  "git": {
    "uri": "https://github.com/openshift/ruby-hello-world.git", <1>
    "httpProxy"  : "http://someproxy.com", <2>
    "httpsProxy" : "https://someproxy.com" <3>
  }
}
----

<1> Must be an HTTP or HTTPS URI.
<2> Specify the HTTP proxy to use.
<3> Specify the HTTPS proxy to use.
====

[[starting-a-build]]

== Starting a Build
Manually invoke a build using the following command:

----
$ oc start-build <buildConfigName>
----

Re-run a build using the `--from-build` flag:

----
$ oc start-build --from-build=<buildName>
----

Specify the `--follow` flag to stream the build's logs in stdout:

----
$ oc start-build <buildConfigName> --follow
----

[[canceling-a-build]]

== Canceling a Build
Manually cancel a build using the following command:

----
$ oc cancel-build <buildName>
----

[[accessing-build-logs]]

== Accessing Build Logs
To allow access to build logs, use the following command:

----
$ oc build-logs <buildName>
----

*Source Build Logs*

By default, link:../architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.html#builds[source
builds] show full output of the *_assemble_* script and all subsequent errors.
To enable more verbose output, pass the `*BUILD_LOGLEVEL*` environment variable
as part of the `*sourceStrategy*` in a `*buildConfig*`:

====

----
{
  "sourceStrategy": {
    ...
    "env": [
      {
        "Name": "BUILD_LOGLEVEL",
        "Value": "2" <1>
      }
    ]
  }
}
----

<1> Adjust this value to the desired log level.
====

NOTE: A platform administrator can set verbosity for the entire OpenShift
instance by passing the `--loglevel` option to the `openshift start` command.
If both `--loglevel` and `BUILD_LOGLEVEL` are specified, `BUILD_LOGLEVEL` takes precedence.

Available log levels for Source builds are as follows:

[horizontal]
Level 0:: Produces output from containers running the *_assemble_* script and all encountered errors. This is the default.
Level 1:: Produces basic information about the executed process.
Level 2:: Produces very detailed information about the executed process.
Level 3:: Produces very detailed information about the executed process, and a listing of the archive contents.
Level 5:: Produces everything mentioned on previous levels and additionally provides docker push messages.

[[source-code]]

== Source Code
The source code location is one of the required parameters for the
`*buildConfig*`. The build uses this location and fetches the source code that
is later built. The source code location definition is part of the
`*parameters*` section in the `*buildConfig*`:

====

----
{
  "source" : {
    "type" : "Git", <1>
    "git" : { <2>
      "uri": "git://github.com/openshift/ruby-hello-world.git"
    },
    "contextDir": "app/dir", <3>
  },
}
----

<1> The `*type*` field describes which SCM is used to fetch your source code.
<2> The `*git*` field contains the URI to the remote Git repository of the
source code. Optionally, specify the `*ref*` field to check out a specific Git
reference. A valid `*ref*` can be a SHA1 tag or a branch name.
<3> The `*contextDir*` field allows you to override the default location inside
the source code repository where the build looks for the application source
code. If your application exists inside a sub-directory, you can override the
default location (the root folder) using this field.
====

[[configuring-the-source-environment]]
== Source Environment

There are two ways to make environment variables available to the
link:../architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.html#builds[source build]
process and resulting \image: link:#environment-files[environment files] and
link:#buildconfig-environment[buildConfig environment] values.

[[environment-files]]

=== Environment Files
Source build enables you to set environment values (one per line) inside your
application, by specifying them in a *_.sti/environment_* file in the source
repository. The environment variables specified in this file are present during
the build process and in the final docker image. The complete list of supported
environment variables is available in the
link:../using_images/overview.html[documentation] for each image.

If you provide a *_.sti/environment_* file in your source repository, S2I reads
this file during the build. This allows customization of the build behavior as
the *_assemble_* script may use these variables.

For example, if you want to disable assets compilation for your Rails
application, you can add `*DISABLE_ASSET_COMPILATION=true*` in the
*_.sti/environment_* file to cause assets compilation to be skipped during the
build.

In addition to builds, the specified environment variables are also available in
the running application itself. For example, you can add
`*RAILS_ENV=development*` to the *_.sti/environment_* file to cause the Rails
application to start in `development` mode instead of `production`.

[[buildconfig-environment]]

=== BuildConfig Environment
You can add environment variables to the `*sourceStrategy*` definition of the
`*buildConfig*`. Defined environment variables are visible during the *_assemble_*
script execution and will be defined in the output image, making them also
available to the *_run_* script and application code.

For example disabling assets compilation for your Rails application:

====

----
{
  "sourceStrategy": {
    ...
    "env": [
      {
        "Name": "DISABLE_ASSET_COMPILATION",
        "Value": "true"
      }
    ]
  }
}
----
====

[[build-triggers]]

== Build Triggers
When defining a `*buildConfig*`, you can define triggers to control the
circumstances in which the `*buildConfig*` should be run. There are two types of
triggers available:

* link:#webhook-triggers[Webhook]
* link:#image-change-triggers[Image change]

[[webhook-triggers]]

=== Webhook Triggers
Webhook triggers allow you to trigger a new build by sending a request to the
OpenShift API endpoint. You can define these triggers using
https://developer.github.com/webhooks/[GitHub webhooks] or Generic webhooks.

*GitHub Webhooks*

https://developer.github.com/webhooks/creating/[GitHub webhooks] handle the call
made by GitHub when a repository is updated. When defining the trigger, you must
specify a link:../dev_guide/secrets.html[`*secret*`] as part of the URL you supply
to GitHub when configuring the webhook. The `*secret*` ensures that only you and
your repository can trigger the build. The following example is a trigger
definition JSON within the `*buildConfig*`:

====

----
{
  "type": "github",
  "github": {
    "secret": "secret101"
  }
}
----
====

The payload URL is returned as the GitHub Webhook URL by the `describe` command
(see link:#describe-buildconfig[below]), and is structured as follows:

----
http://<openshift_api_host:port>/osapi/v1/namespaces/<namespace>/buildconfigs/<name>/webhooks/<secret>/github
----

*Generic Webhooks*

Generic webhooks can be invoked from any system capable of making a web
request. As with a GitHub webhook, you must specify a `*secret*` when defining the
trigger, and the caller must provide this `*secret*` to trigger the build. The
following is an example trigger definition JSON within the `*buildConfig*`:

====

----
{
  "type": "generic",
  "generic": {
    "secret": "secret101"
  }
}
----
====

To set up the caller, supply the calling system with the URL of the generic
webhook endpoint for your build:

----
http://<openshift_api_host:port>/osapi/v1/namespaces/<namespace>/buildconfigs/<name>/webhooks/<secret>/generic
----

The endpoint can accept an optional payload with the following format:

====

----
{
  type: 'git',
  git: {
    uri: '<url to git repository>',
    ref: '<optional git reference>',
    commit: '<commit hash identifying a specific git commit>',
    author: {
      name: '<author name>',
      email: '<author e-mail>',
    },
    committer: {
      name: '<committer name>',
      email: '<committer e-mail>',
    },
    message: '<commit message>'
  }
}
----
====

[#describe-buildconfig]
*Displaying a BuildConfig's Webhook URLs*

Use the following command to display the webhook URLs associated with a build
configuration:

----
$ oc describe buildConfig <name>
----

If the above command does not display any webhook URLs, then no webhook trigger
is defined for that build configuration.

[[image-change-triggers]]

=== Image Change Triggers
Image change triggers allow your build to be automatically invoked when a new
version of an upstream image is available. For example, if a build is based on
top of a RHEL image, then you can trigger that build to run any time the RHEL
image changes. As a result, the application image is always running on the
latest RHEL base image.

Configuring an image change trigger requires the following actions:

. Define an `*ImageStream*` that points to the upstream image you want to
trigger on:
+
====

----
{
  "kind": "ImageStream",
  "apiVersion": "v1",
  "metadata": {
    "name": "ruby-20-centos7"
  }
}
----
====
+
This defines the image stream that is tied to a Docker image repository
located at `_<system-registry>_/_<namespace>_/ruby-20-centos7`. The
`_<system-registry>_` is defined as a service with the name `docker-registry`
running in OpenShift.

. Define a build with a strategy that consumes the image stream:
+
====

----
{
  "strategy": {
    "type": "Source",
    "sourceStrategy": {
      "from": {
        "kind": "ImageStreamTag",
        "name": "ruby-20-centos7:latest"
      },
    }
  }
}
----
====
+
In this case, the `*sourceStrategy*` definition is consuming the `latest` tag of
the image stream named `ruby-20-centos7` located within this namespace.

. Define an image change trigger:
+
====

----
{
  "type": "imageChange",
  "imageChange": {}
}
----
====
+
This defines an image change trigger that monitors the `*ImageStream*` and
`*Tag*` as defined by the strategy's `*from*` field. When a change occurs, a new
build is triggered and is supplied with an immutable Docker tag that points to
the new image that was just created. This new image will be used by the strategy
when it executes for the build. For example, the resulting build will be:
+
====

----
{
  "strategy": {
    "type": "Source",
    "sourceStrategy": {
      "from": {
        "kind": "DockerImage",
        "name": "172.30.17.3:5001/mynamespace/ruby-20-centos7:immutableid"
      }
    }
  }
}
----
====

This ensures that the triggered build uses the new image that was just pushed to
the repository, and the build can be re-run any time with the same inputs.

In addition to setting the image field for all `*Strategy*` types, for custom
builds, the `OPENSHIFT_CUSTOM_BUILD_BASE_IMAGE` environment variable is checked.
If it does not exist, then it is created with the immutable image reference. If
it does exist then it is updated with the immutable image reference.

If a build is triggered due to a webhook trigger or manual request,
the build that is created uses the `*immutableid*` resolved from the
`*ImageStream*` referenced by the `*Strategy*`. This ensures that builds
are performed using consistent image tags for ease of reproduction.

[#using-docker-credentials-for-pushing-and-pulling-images]
== Using Docker Credentials for Pushing and Pulling Images

Supply the `.dockercfg` file with valid Docker Registry credentials in order to
push the output image into a private Docker Registry or pull the builder image
from the private Docker Registry that requires authentication. For the OpenShift
Docker Registry, you don't have to do this because `*secrets*` are generated
automatically for you by OpenShift.

The *_.dockercfg_* JSON file is found in your home directory by default and has
the following format:

====

----
{
	"https://index.docker.io/v1/": { <1>
		"auth": "YWRfbGzhcGU6R2labnRib21ifTE=", <2>
		"email": "user@example.com" <3>
	}
}
----

<1> URL of the registry.
<2> Encrypted password.
<3> Email address for the login.
====

You can define multiple Docker registry entries in this file. Alternatively, you
can also add authentication entries to this file by running the `docker login`
command. The file will be created if it does not exist. Kubernetes provides
https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubernetes/blob/master/docs/design/secrets.md[`*secret*`],
which are used to store your configuration and passwords.

. Create the `*secret*` from your local `.dockercfg` file:
+
====
----
$ oc secrets new dockerhub ~/.dockercfg
----
====
+
This generates a JSON specification of the `*secret*` named *dockerhub* and
creates the object.

. Once the `*secret*` is created, add it to the builder service account:
+
====
----
$ oc secrets add serviceaccount/builder secrets/dockerhub
----
====

. Add a `PushSecret` field into the `Output` section of the `*buildConfig*` and
set it to the name of the `*secret*` that you created, which in the above example
is *dockerhub*:
+
====

----
{
  "parameters": {
    "output": {
      "to": {
        "name": "private-image"
      },
      "pushSecret":{
        "name": "dockerhub"
      }
    }
  }
}
----
====

. Pull the builder Docker image from a private Docker registry by specifying the
`PullSecret` field, which is part of the build strategy definition:
+
====

----
{
  "strategy": {
    "sourceStrategy": {
      "from": {
        "kind": "DockerImage",
        "name": "docker.io/user/private_repository"
       },
       "pullSecret": {
        "name": "dockerhub"
       },
    },
    "type": "Source"
  }
}
----
====

[#using-private-repositories-for-builds]
== Using Private Repositories for Builds

Supply valid credentials to build an application from a private repository.
Currently, only SSH key based authentication is supported. The repository keys
are located in the `$HOME/.ssh/` directory, and are named `id_dsa.pub`,
`id_ecdsa.pub`, `id_ed25519.pub`, or `id_rsa.pub` by default. Generate SSH key
credentials with the following command:

====

----
$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "your_email@example.com"
----
====

Two files are created: the public key and a corresponding private key (one of
`id_dsa`, `id_ecdsa`, `id_ed25519`, or `id_rsa`). With both of these in place,
consult your source control management (SCM) system's manual on how to upload
the public key. The private key will be used to access your private repository.

A link:dev_guide/secrets[`*secret*`]
is used to store your keys.

. Create the `*secret*` first before using the SSH key to access the private
repository:
+
====
----
$ oc secrets new scmsecret ssh-privatekey=$HOME/.ssh/id_rsa
----
====


. Add the `*secret*` to the builder service account:
+
====

----
$ oc secrets add serviceaccount/builder secrets/scmsecret
----
====


. Add a `*sourceSecret*` field into the `*source*` section inside the
buildConfig and set it to the name of the `*secret*` that you created, in this
case `*scmsecret*`:
+
====

----
{
  "apiVersion": "v1",
  "kind": "BuildConfig",
  "metadata": {
    "name": "sample-build",
