== Overview

The `osc new-app` command creates a new application in OpenShift by specifying
source code, templates, and/or images. It tries to build up the components of an
application using images, stored templates, or code located on your system. It 
looks up the images on the local Docker installation (if available), a Docker 
registry, or an OpenShift image stream.

If you specify a source code URL, it sets up a build that takes your source code
and converts it into an image that can run inside of a pod. The images are
deployed via a deployment configuration, and a service is hooked up to the first
public port of the application.

NOTE: If you specify source code, you may need to
link:builds.html#starting-a-build[run a build] with `osc start-build` after the
application is created.

== Using the CLI

To try to create an application based on the source code in the current
directory, run:

----
$ osc new-app .
----

To use the public DockerHub MySQL image to create an application, run:

----
$ osc new-app mysql
----

To use a MySQL image in a private registry to create an application, run:

----
$ osc new-app myregistry.com/mycompany/mysql
----

To create an application from the remote repository using the specified label,
run:

----
$ osc new-app https://github.com/openshift/ruby-hello-world -l name=hello-world
----

You can use a link:templates.html[Template] previously stored to create. For 
example, store the template from the 
link:../getting_started/dev_get_started/try_it_out.html#sample-application-lifecycle[sample application]
using `osc create -f examples/sample-app/application-template-stibuild.json` and 
then create an application based on it, running:

----
$ osc new-app ruby-helloworld-sample
----

When creating based on a stored template, use the `-p|--param` to set parameter
values defined by the template:

----
$ osc new-app ruby-helloworld-sample -p ADMIN_USERNAME=myuser,ADMIN_PASSWORD=mypass
----

== Using the Management Console

Applications can also be created using the Management Console.  To create an application:

1. While in the desired project, click on the *Create+* button:
+
====

image:console_create.png["Console Create"]
====

2. Enter the repository URL for the application to build:
+
====

image:console_enter_source_uri.png["Enter Source Repository"]
====

3. Select a builder image from the list of images in your project, or provided by
the global library:
+
====

image:console_select_image.png["Select Builder Image"]
====

4. Modify the settings in the new application screen to configure the resources that will support your application:
+
====

image:create_from_image.png["Create from source"]
====
<1> Builder image name and description.
<2> Application name used for the generated OpenShift resources.
<3> Routing configuration section to make this application publicly accessible.
<4> Deployment configuration section to customize deployment triggers and image environment variables.
<5> Build configuration section to customize build triggers.
<6> Replica scaling section to configure the number of running instances of the application.
<7> Labels to assign to all items generated for the application. You can add and edit labels for all resources.
