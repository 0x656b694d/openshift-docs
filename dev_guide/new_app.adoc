== Overview

Create a new OpenShift application by using the
link:../architecture/infrastructure_components/web_console.html[web console] or
by running the `oc new-app` command from the CLI. OpenShift creates a new
application by specifying source code,
link:../architecture/core_concepts/templates.html[templates], and
link:../architecture/core_concepts/containers_and_images.html#docker-images[images].
OpenShift looks for images on the local Docker installation (if available), in a
link:../architecture/infrastructure_components/image_registry.html[Docker
registry], or an OpenShift image stream.

If you specify a source code URL, OpenShift takes your source code and converts
it into an image that can run inside of a
link:../architecture/core_concepts/pods_and_services.html#pods[pod]. Images are
deployed via a
link:../architecture/core_concepts/deployments.html#deployments-and-deployment-configurations[deployment
configuration], and a
link:../architecture/core_concepts/pods_and_services.html#services[service] is
hooked up to the first public port of the application.

[NOTE]
====
If you specify source code, you may need to
link:builds.html#starting-a-build[run a build] with `oc start-build` after the
application is created.
====

== Using the CLI

To create an application based on the source code in the current
directory:

----
$ oc new-app .
----

To create an application using a public DockerHub image:

----
$ oc new-app <image_name>
----

.Creating an Application from the https://registry.hub.docker.com/_/mysql/[DockerHub MySQL Image]:
====
----
$ oc new-app mysql
----
====

To create an application using an image in a private registry, specify the file
path:

----
$ oc new-app <myregistry.com>/<mycompany>/<image_name>
----

You can also apply a label when creating an application. This is recommended, as
labels make it easy to collectively select, manipulate, and delete objects
associated with the application. See the
link:../cli_reference/basic_cli_operations.html#common-operations[CLI Reference]
for more details. For example, to apply label `name=hello-world` when creating
an application from the `ruby-hello-world` remote repository:

====
----
$ oc new-app https://github.com/openshift/ruby-hello-world -l name=hello-world
----
====

You can use a previously-stored link:templates.html[template] to create an
application. For example, store a
https://github.com/openshift/origin/tree/master/examples/sample-app[sample
application template] and use it to create an application:

====
----
$ oc create -f examples/sample-app/application-template-stibuild.json
$ oc new-app ruby-helloworld-sample
----
====

When creating an application based on a stored link:templates.html[template],
use the `-p|--param` to set parameter values defined by the template:

----
$ oc new-app <template_name> -p ADMIN_USERNAME=<user>,ADMIN_PASSWORD=<pass>
----

== Using the Web Console

You can also create applications using the
link:../architecture/infrastructure_components/web_console.html[web console]:

1. While in the desired project, click *Create+*:
+
====

image:console_create.png["Web Console Create"]
====

2. Enter the repository URL for the application to build:
+
====

image:console_enter_source_uri.png["Enter Source Repository"]
====

3. Select either a builder image from the list of images in your project, or
from the global library:
+
====

image:console_select_image.png["Select Builder Image"]
====

4. Modify the settings in the new application screen to configure the resources
to support your application:
+
====

image:create_from_image.png["Create from source"]
====
<1> The builder image name and description.
<2> The application name used for the generated OpenShift resources.
<3> Routing configuration section for making this application publicly accessible.
<4> Deployment configuration section for customizing deployment triggers and image environment variables.
<5> Build configuration section for customizing build triggers.
<6> Replica scaling section for configuring the number of running instances of the application.
<7> The labels to assign to all items generated for the application. You can add and edit labels for all resources here.
