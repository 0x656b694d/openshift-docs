== Overview

Create a new OpenShift application by using the
link:../architecture/infrastructure_components/management_console.html[Management Console]
or by running the `osc new-app` command from the CLI. 
OpenShift creates a new application by specifying source code, 
link:../architecture/core_objects/openshift_model.html#template[templates], 
and 
link:../architecture/core_objects/openshift_model.html#image[images]. 
OpenShift looks for images on the local 
Docker installation (if available), in a 
link:../architecture/infrastructure_components/image_registry.html[Docker registry], 
or an OpenShift image stream.

If you specify a source code URL, OpenShift takes your source code
and converts it into an 
link:../architecture/core_objects/openshift_model.html#image[image] that can 
run inside of a 
link:../architecture/core_objects/kubernetes_model.html#pod[pod]. Images are 
deployed via a 
link:../architecture/core_objects/openshift_model.html#deploymentconfig[deployment configuration], 
and a link:../architecture/core_objects/kubernetes_model.html#service[service] 
is hooked up to the first public port of the application.

[NOTE]
====
If you specify source code, you may need to
link:builds.html#starting-a-build[run a build] with `osc start-build` after the
application is created.
====

== Using the CLI

To create an application based on the source code in the current
directory:

----
$ osc new-app .
----

To create an application using a public DockerHub image:

----
$ osc new-app <image_name>
----

.Creating an Application from a https://registry.hub.docker.com/_/mysql/[MySQL Image]:
====
----
$ osc new-app mysql
----
====

To create an application using an image in a private registry, specify the file 
path:

----
$ osc new-app <myregistry.com>/<mycompany>/<image_name>
----

You can also create an application from a remote repository using a label. For 
example, to create an application from the `ruby-hello-world` remote repository:

====
----
$ osc new-app https://github.com/openshift/ruby-hello-world -l name=hello-world
----
====

You can use a previously-stored link:templates.html[template] to create an 
application. For example, store the
link:../getting_started/dev_get_started/try_it_out.html#sample-application-lifecycle[sample application template]
and use it to create an application:

====
----
$ osc create -f examples/sample-app/application-template-stibuild.json
$ osc new-app ruby-helloworld-sample
----
====

When creating an application based on a stored link:templates.html[template], 
use the `-p|--param` to set parameter values defined by the template:

----
$ osc new-app <template_name> -p ADMIN_USERNAME=<user>,ADMIN_PASSWORD=<pass>
----

== Using the Management Console

You can also create applications using the 
link:../architecture/infrastructure_components/management_console.html[Management Console]:

1. While in the desired project, click *Create+*:
+
====

image:console_create.png["Console Create"]
====

2. Enter the repository URL for the application to build:
+
====

image:console_enter_source_uri.png["Enter Source Repository"]
====

3. Select either a builder image from the list of images in your project, or 
from the global library:
+
====

image:console_select_image.png["Select Builder Image"]
====

4. Modify the settings in the new application screen to configure the resources 
to support your application:
+
====

image:create_from_image.png["Create from source"]
====
<1> The builder image name and description.
<2> The application name used for the generated OpenShift resources.
<3> Routing configuration section for making this application publicly accessible.
<4> Deployment configuration section for customizing deployment triggers and image environment variables.
<5> Build configuration section for customizing build triggers.
<6> Replica scaling section for configuring the number of running instances of the application.
<7> The labels to assign to all items generated for the application. You can add and edit labels for all resources here.
