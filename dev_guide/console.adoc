Use the left tabs to navigate within a project:

Overview:: Visualize the contents of your project with a high-level view of each component.
Browse:: Explore the different resource types within your project.
Settings:: General information about your project, as well as the  link:../architecture/core_objects/kubernetes_model.html#resourcequota[quota] and link:../architecture/core_objects/kubernetes_model.html#limitrange[resource limits] that are set on your project.

== Filtering by Labels
Filter the contents of a project page by using the labels of a resource. You can
pick from a suggested label name and values, or type in your own. Multiple
filters can be added. When multiple filters are applied, resources must match
all of the filters to remain visible.

To filter by labels:
