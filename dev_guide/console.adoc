of your projects.

NOTE: JavaScript must be enabled to use the Management Console. For the best
experience, use a web browser that supports

== Navigating
The Management Console's navigation structure is focused around projects. The
project selector allows you to switch between projects you have access to:

Use the left tabs to navigate within a project:

Overview:: Visualize the contents of your project with a high-level view of each component.
Browse:: Explore the different resource types within your project.
Settings:: General information about your project, as well as the  link:../architecture/core_objects/kubernetes_model.html#resourcequota[quota] and link:../architecture/core_objects/kubernetes_model.html#limitrange[resource limits] that are set on your project.

== Filtering by Labels
Filter the contents of a project page by using the labels of a resource. You can
pick from a suggested label name and values, or type in your own. Multiple
filters can be added. When multiple filters are applied, resources must match
all of the filters to remain visible.

To filter by labels:

. Select a label type:

exists:: Verify that the label name exists, but ignore its value.

not in:: Verify that the label name does not exist, or is not equal to any of the selected values.
