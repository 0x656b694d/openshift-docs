This branch contains content for Microsoft ARO work done by Red Hat writers.

## Guidelines
- Review [Microsoft's contributor's guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/contribute/).
- Language to use is Markdown.
- Templates to use are in the markdowntemplates folder. Fit your stories in the provided templates.
- Keep all markdown files relevant to the story in one folder so it is self contained. There are no common files/folders between features. We cannot guarantee common folders can be copy pasted easily to the Microsoft side.
- Normal OpenShift docs SME/QE/Peer review practices apply.
- There is no build process to validate links or build the content.
- There is no automatic preview, except for normal GitHub inline preview of Markdown content.

## Workflow
- Create a folder with the same name as the Jira ticket for the feature you are documenting. For example: OSDOCS1234
- Tag Jerome Boutaud when you are ready for SME/QE validation.
- Add qe-approved label when SME/QE is done.
- Tag the peer review squad in team-docs.
- Add label 'ready' when it is ready for publication on Microsoft side.
- Tag Vikram Goyal and/or Stephanie Stout when you add the 'ready' label.
