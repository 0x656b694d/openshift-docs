| Property | Type | Description

| `.apiVersion`
| `string`

| `.kind`
| `string`
| Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds

| `.metadata`
| xref:../objects/index.adoc#objectmeta-meta-v1[`ObjectMeta meta/v1`]
| Standard object's metadata. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata

| `.spec`
| `object`
| OperatorGroupSpec is the spec for an OperatorGroup resource.

| `.status`
| `object`
| OperatorGroupStatus is the status for an OperatorGroupResource.

| Property | Type | Description

| `selector`
| `object`
| Selector selects the OperatorGroup's target namespaces.

| `serviceAccountName`
| `string`
| ServiceAccountName is the admin specified service account which will be used to deploy operator(s) in this operator group.

| `staticProvidedAPIs`
| `boolean`
| Static tells OLM not to update the OperatorGroup's providedAPIs annotation

| `targetNamespaces`
| `array (string)`
| TargetNamespaces is an explicit set of namespaces to target. If it is set, Selector is ignored.

| Property | Type | Description

| `matchExpressions`
| `array`
| matchExpressions is a list of label selector requirements. The requirements are ANDed.

| `matchExpressions[]`
| `object`
| A label selector requirement is a selector that contains values, a key, and an operator that relates the key and values.

| `matchLabels`
| `object (string)`
| matchLabels is a map of {key,value} pairs. A single {key,value} in the matchLabels map is equivalent to an element of matchExpressions, whose key field is "key", the operator is "In", and the values array contains only "value". The requirements are ANDed.

|===
..spec.selector.matchExpressions
Description::
  matchExpressions is a list of label selector requirements. The requirements are ANDed.

Type::
  `array`




..spec.selector.matchExpressions[]
Description::
  A label selector requirement is a selector that contains values, a key, and an operator that relates the key and values.

Type::

Required::
  - `key`
  - `operator`



[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `key`
| `string`
| key is the label key that the selector applies to.

| `operator`
| `string`
| operator represents a key's relationship to a set of values. Valid operators are In, NotIn, Exists and DoesNotExist.

| `values`
| `array (string)`
| values is an array of string values. If the operator is In or NotIn, the values array must be non-empty. If the operator is Exists or DoesNotExist, the values array must be empty. This array is replaced during a strategic merge patch.

|===
..status
Description::
  OperatorGroupStatus is the status for an OperatorGroupResource.

Type::
  `object`

Required::
  - `lastUpdated`



[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]

| `lastUpdated`
| `string`
| LastUpdated is a timestamp of the last time the OperatorGroup's status was Updated.

| `namespaces`
| `array (string)`
| Namespaces is the set of target namespaces for the OperatorGroup.

| `serviceAccountRef`
| `object`
| ServiceAccountRef references the service account object specified.

|===
..status.serviceAccountRef
Description::
  ServiceAccountRef references the service account object specified.

Type::
  `object`




[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `apiVersion`
| `string`
| API version of the referent.

| `fieldPath`
| `string`
| If referring to a piece of an object instead of an entire object, this string should contain a valid JSON/Go field access statement, such as desiredState.manifest.containers[2]. For example, if the object reference is to a container within a pod, this would take on a value like: "spec.containers{name}" (where "name" refers to the name of the container that triggered the event) or if no container name is specified "spec.containers[2]" (container with index 2 in this pod). This syntax is chosen only to have some well-defined way of referencing a part of an object. TODO: this design is not final and this field is subject to change in the future.

| `kind`
| `string`
| Kind of the referent. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds

| `name`
| `string`
| Name of the referent. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#names

| `namespace`
| `string`
| Namespace of the referent. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/

| `resourceVersion`
| `string`
| Specific resourceVersion to which this reference is made, if any. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#concurrency-control-and-consistency

| `uid`
