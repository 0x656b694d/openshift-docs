Description::
  An ImageStream stores a mapping of tags to images, metadata overrides that are applied when images are tagged in a stream, and an optional reference to a container image repository on a registry. Users typically update the spec.tags field to point to external images which are imported from container registries using credentials in your namespace with the pull secret type, or to existing image stream tags and images which are immediately accessible for tagging or pulling. The history of images applied to a tag is visible in the status.tags field and any user who can view an image stream is allowed to tag that image into their own image streams. Access to pull images from the integrated registry is granted by having the &quot;get imagestreams/layers&quot; permission on a given image stream. Users may remove a tag by deleting the imagestreamtag resource, which causes both spec and status for that tag to be removed. Image stream history is retained until an administrator runs the prune operation, which removes references that are no longer in use. To preserve a historical image, ensure there is a tag in spec pointing to that image by its digest.

Type::
  `object`



== Specification

[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `.apiVersion`
| `string`
| APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources

| `.kind`
| `string`
| Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds

| `.metadata`
| xref:../objects/index.adoc#objectmeta-meta-v1[`ObjectMeta meta/v1`]
| 

| `.spec`
| `object`
| ImageStreamSpec represents options for ImageStreams.

| `.status`
| `object`
| ImageStreamStatus contains information about the state of this image stream.

|===
..spec
Description::
  ImageStreamSpec represents options for ImageStreams.

Type::
  `object`




[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `dockerImageRepository`
| `string`
| dockerImageRepository is optional, if specified this stream is backed by a container repository on this server Deprecated: This field is deprecated as of v3.7 and will be removed in a future release. Specify the source for the tags to be imported in each tag via the spec.tags.from reference instead.

| `lookupPolicy`
| `object`
| ImageLookupPolicy describes how an image stream can be used to override the image references used by pods, builds, and other resources in a namespace.

| `tags`
| `array`
| tags map arbitrary string values to specific image locators

| `tags[]`
| `object`
| TagReference specifies optional annotations for images using this tag and an optional reference to an ImageStreamTag, ImageStreamImage, or DockerImage this tag should track.

|===
..spec.lookupPolicy
Description::
  ImageLookupPolicy describes how an image stream can be used to override the image references used by pods, builds, and other resources in a namespace.

Type::
  `object`

Required::
  - `local`



[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `local`
| `boolean`
| local will change the docker short image references (like "mysql" or "php:latest") on objects in this namespace to the image ID whenever they match this image stream, instead of reaching out to a remote registry. The name will be fully qualified to an image ID if found. The tag's referencePolicy is taken into account on the replaced value. Only works within the current namespace.

|===
..spec.tags
Description::
  tags map arbitrary string values to specific image locators

Type::
  `array`




..spec.tags[]
Description::
  TagReference specifies optional annotations for images using this tag and an optional reference to an ImageStreamTag, ImageStreamImage, or DockerImage this tag should track.

Type::
  `object`

Required::
  - `name`



[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `annotations`
| `object (string)`
| Optional; if specified, annotations that are applied to images retrieved via ImageStreamTags.

| `from`
| xref:../objects/index.adoc#objectreference-core-v1[`ObjectReference core/v1`]
| Optional; if specified, a reference to another image that this tag should point to. Valid values are ImageStreamTag, ImageStreamImage, and DockerImage.  ImageStreamTag references can only reference a tag within this same ImageStream.

| `generation`
| `integer`
| Generation is a counter that tracks mutations to the spec tag (user intent). When a tag reference is changed the generation is set to match the current stream generation (which is incremented every time spec is changed). Other processes in the system like the image importer observe that the generation of spec tag is newer than the generation recorded in the status and use that as a trigger to import the newest remote tag. To trigger a new import, clients may set this value to zero which will reset the generation to the latest stream generation. Legacy clients will send this value as nil which will be merged with the current tag generation.

| `importPolicy`
| `object`
| TagImportPolicy controls how images related to this tag will be imported.

| `name`
| `string`
| Name of the tag

| `reference`
| `boolean`
| Reference states if the tag will be imported. Default value is false, which means the tag will be imported.

| `referencePolicy`
| `object`
| TagReferencePolicy describes how pull-specs for images in this image stream tag are generated when image change triggers in deployment configs or builds are resolved. This allows the image stream author to control how images are accessed.

|===
..spec.tags[].importPolicy
Description::
  TagImportPolicy controls how images related to this tag will be imported.

Type::
  `object`




[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `insecure`
| `boolean`
| Insecure is true if the server may bypass certificate verification or connect directly over HTTP during image import.

| `scheduled`
| `boolean`
| Scheduled indicates to the server that this tag should be periodically checked to ensure it is up to date, and imported

|===
..spec.tags[].referencePolicy
Description::
  TagReferencePolicy describes how pull-specs for images in this image stream tag are generated when image change triggers in deployment configs or builds are resolved. This allows the image stream author to control how images are accessed.

Type::
  `object`

Required::
  - `type`



[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `type`
| `string`
| Type determines how the image pull spec should be transformed when the image stream tag is used in deployment config triggers or new builds. The default value is `Source`, indicating the original location of the image should be used (if imported). The user may also specify `Local`, indicating that the pull spec should point to the integrated container image registry and leverage the registry's ability to proxy the pull to an upstream registry. `Local` allows the credentials used to pull this image to be managed from the image stream's namespace, so others on the platform can access a remote image but have no access to the remote secret. It also allows the image layers to be mirrored into the local registry which the images can still be pulled even if the upstream registry is unavailable.
