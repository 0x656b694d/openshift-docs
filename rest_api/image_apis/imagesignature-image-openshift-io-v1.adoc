Description::
  ImageSignature holds a signature of an image. It allows to verify image identity and possibly other claims as long as the signature is trusted. Based on this information it is possible to restrict runnable images to those matching cluster-wide policy. Mandatory fields should be parsed by clients doing image verification. The others are parsed from signature&#x27;s content by the server. They serve just an informative purpose.

Type::
  `object`

Required::
  - `type`
  - `content`


== Specification

|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `.apiVersion`
| `string`
| APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources

| `.conditions`
| `array`
| Conditions represent the latest available observations of a signature's current state.

| `.conditions[]`
| `object`
| SignatureCondition describes an image signature condition of particular kind at particular probe time.

| `.content`
| `string`
| Required: An opaque binary string which is an image's signature.

| `.created`
| xref:../objects/index.adoc#time-meta-v1[`Time meta/v1`]
| If specified, it is the time of signature's creation.

| `.imageIdentity`
| `string`
| A human readable string representing image's identity. It could be a product name and version, or an image pull spec (e.g. "registry.access.redhat.com/rhel7/rhel:7.2").

| `.issuedBy`
| `object`
| SignatureIssuer holds information about an issuer of signing certificate or key.

| `.issuedTo`
| `object`
| SignatureSubject holds information about a person or entity who created the signature.

| `.kind`
| `string`
| Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds

| `.metadata`
| xref:../objects/index.adoc#objectmeta-meta-v1[`ObjectMeta meta/v1`]
| 

| `.signedClaims`
| `object (string)`
| Contains claims from the signature.

| `.type`
| `string`
| Required: Describes a type of stored blob.
