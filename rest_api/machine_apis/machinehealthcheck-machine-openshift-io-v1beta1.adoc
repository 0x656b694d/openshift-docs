Description::
  MachineHealthCheck is the Schema for the machinehealthchecks API

Type::
  `object`



== Specification

[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `.apiVersion`
| `string`
| APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources

| `.kind`
| `string`
| Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds

| `.metadata`
| xref:../objects/index.adoc#objectmeta-meta-v1[`ObjectMeta meta/v1`]
| Standard object's metadata. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata

| `.spec`
| `object`
| Specification of machine health check policy

| `.status`
| `object`
| Most recently observed status of MachineHealthCheck resource

|===
..spec
Description::
  Specification of machine health check policy

Type::
  `object`

Required::
  - `selector`
  - `unhealthyConditions`



[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `maxUnhealthy`
| `integer-or-string`
| Any farther remediation is only allowed if at most "MaxUnhealthy" machines selected by "selector" are not healthy.

| `nodeStartupTimeout`
| `string`
| Machines older than this duration without a node will be considered to have failed and will be remediated.

| `selector`
| `object`
| Label selector to match machines whose health will be exercised. Note: An empty selector will match all machines.

| `unhealthyConditions`
| `array`
| UnhealthyConditions contains a list of the conditions that determine whether a node is considered unhealthy.  The conditions are combined in a logical OR, i.e. if any of the conditions is met, the node is unhealthy.

| `unhealthyConditions[]`
| `object`
| UnhealthyCondition represents a Node condition type and value with a timeout specified as a duration.  When the named condition has been in the given status for at least the timeout value, a node is considered unhealthy.

|===
..spec.selector
Description::
  Label selector to match machines whose health will be exercised. Note: An empty selector will match all machines.

Type::
  `object`




[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `matchExpressions`
| `array`
| matchExpressions is a list of label selector requirements. The requirements are ANDed.

| `matchExpressions[]`
| `object`
| A label selector requirement is a selector that contains values, a key, and an operator that relates the key and values.

| `matchLabels`
| `object (string)`
| matchLabels is a map of {key,value} pairs. A single {key,value} in the matchLabels map is equivalent to an element of matchExpressions, whose key field is "key", the operator is "In", and the values array contains only "value". The requirements are ANDed.

|===
..spec.selector.matchExpressions
Description::
  matchExpressions is a list of label selector requirements. The requirements are ANDed.

Type::
  `array`




..spec.selector.matchExpressions[]
Description::
  A label selector requirement is a selector that contains values, a key, and an operator that relates the key and values.

Type::
  `object`

Required::
  - `key`
  - `operator`



[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `key`
| `string`
| key is the label key that the selector applies to.

| `operator`
| `string`
| operator represents a key's relationship to a set of values. Valid operators are In, NotIn, Exists and DoesNotExist.

| `values`
| `array (string)`
| values is an array of string values. If the operator is In or NotIn, the values array must be non-empty. If the operator is Exists or DoesNotExist, the values array must be empty. This array is replaced during a strategic merge patch.

|===
..spec.unhealthyConditions
Description::
  UnhealthyConditions contains a list of the conditions that determine whether a node is considered unhealthy.  The conditions are combined in a logical OR, i.e. if any of the conditions is met, the node is unhealthy.

Type::
  `array`




..spec.unhealthyConditions[]
Description::
  UnhealthyCondition represents a Node condition type and value with a timeout specified as a duration.  When the named condition has been in the given status for at least the timeout value, a node is considered unhealthy.

Type::
  `object`

Required::
  - `status`
  - `timeout`
