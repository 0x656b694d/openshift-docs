== Specification

[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `.apiVersion`
| `string`
| APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources

| `.egressCIDRs`
| `array (string)`
| EgressCIDRs is the list of CIDR ranges available for automatically assigning egress IPs to this node from. If this field is set then EgressIPs should be treated as read-only.

| `.egressIPs`
| `array (string)`
| EgressIPs is the list of automatic egress IP addresses currently hosted by this node. If EgressCIDRs is empty, this can be set by hand; if EgressCIDRs is set then the master will overwrite the value here with its own allocation of egress IPs.

| `.host`
| `string`
| Host is the name of the node. (This is the same as the object's name, but both fields must be set.)

| `.hostIP`
| `string`
| HostIP is the IP address to be used as a VTEP by other nodes in the overlay network

| `.kind`
| `string`
| Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds

| `.metadata`
| xref:../objects/index.adoc#objectmeta-meta-v1[`ObjectMeta meta/v1`]
| Standard object's metadata. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata

| `.subnet`
| `string`
| Subnet is the CIDR range of the overlay network assigned to the node for its pods
