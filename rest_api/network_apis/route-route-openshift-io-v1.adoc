Description::
  A route allows developers to expose services through an HTTP(S) aware load balancing and proxy layer via a public DNS entry. The route may further specify TLS options and a certificate, or specify a public CNAME that the router should also accept for HTTP and HTTPS traffic. An administrator typically configures their router to be visible outside the cluster firewall, and may also add additional security, caching, or traffic controls on the service content. Routers usually talk directly to the service endpoints.

Once a route is created, the &#x60;host&#x60; field may not be changed. Generally, routers use the oldest route with a given host when resolving conflicts.

Routers are subject to additional customization and may support additional controls via the annotations field.

Because administrators may configure multiple routers, the route status field is used to return information to clients about the names and states of the route under each router. If a client chooses a duplicate name, for instance, the route status conditions are used to indicate the route cannot be chosen.

== Specification

[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `.apiVersion`
| `string`
| APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources

| `.kind`
| `string`
| Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds

| `.metadata`
| xref:../objects/index.adoc#objectmeta-meta-v1[`ObjectMeta meta/v1`]
| 

| `.spec`
| `object`
| RouteSpec describes the hostname or path the route exposes, any security information, and one to four backends (services) the route points to. Requests are distributed among the backends depending on the weights assigned to each backend. When using roundrobin scheduling the portion of requests that go to each backend is the backend weight divided by the sum of all of the backend weights. When the backend has more than one endpoint the requests that end up on the backend are roundrobin distributed among the endpoints. Weights are between 0 and 256 with default 100. Weight 0 causes no requests to the backend. If all weights are zero the route will be considered to have no backends and return a standard 503 response.

The `tls` field is optional and allows specific certificates or behavior for the route. Routers typically configure a default certificate on a wildcard domain to terminate routes without explicit certificates, but custom hostnames usually must choose passthrough (send traffic directly to the backend via the TLS Server-Name- Indication field) or provide a certificate.

| `.status`
| `object`
| RouteStatus provides relevant info about the status of a route, including which routers acknowledge it.

| Property | Type | Description

| `alternateBackends`
| `array`
| alternateBackends allows up to 3 additional backends to be assigned to the route. Only the Service kind is allowed, and it will be defaulted to Service. Use the weight field in RouteTargetReference object to specify relative preference.

| `alternateBackends[]`
| `object`
| RouteTargetReference specifies the target that resolve into endpoints. Only the 'Service' kind is allowed. Use 'weight' field to emphasize one over others.

| `host`
| `string`
| host is an alias/DNS that points to the service. Optional. If not specified a route name will typically be automatically chosen. Must follow DNS952 subdomain conventions.

| `path`
| `string`
| path that the router watches for, to route traffic for to the service. Optional

| `port`
| `object`
| RoutePort defines a port mapping from a router to an endpoint in the service endpoints.

| `subdomain`
| `string`
| subdomain is a DNS subdomain that is requested within the ingress controller's domain (as a subdomain). If host is set this field is ignored. An ingress controller may choose to ignore this suggested name, in which case the controller will report the assigned name in the status.ingress array or refuse to admit the route. If this value is set and the server does not support this field host will be populated automatically. Otherwise host is left empty. The field may have multiple parts separated by a dot, but not all ingress controllers may honor the request. This field may not be changed after creation except by a user with the update routes/custom-host permission.

Example: subdomain `frontend` automatically receives the router subdomain `apps.mycluster.com` to have a full hostname `frontend.apps.mycluster.com`.

| `tls`
| `object`
| TLSConfig defines config used to secure a route and provide termination

| `to`
| `object`
| RouteTargetReference specifies the target that resolve into endpoints. Only the 'Service' kind is allowed. Use 'weight' field to emphasize one over others.

| `wildcardPolicy`
| `string`
| Wildcard policy if any for the route. Currently only 'Subdomain' or 'None' is allowed.

If this field is not specified, the router may provide its own destination CA and perform hostname validation using the short service name (service.namespace.svc), which allows infrastructure generated certificates to automatically verify.

| `insecureEdgeTerminationPolicy`
| `string`
| insecureEdgeTerminationPolicy indicates the desired behavior for insecure connections to a route. While each router may make its own decisions on which ports to expose, this is normally port 80.
