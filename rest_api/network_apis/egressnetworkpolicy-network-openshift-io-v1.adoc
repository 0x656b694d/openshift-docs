Description::
  EgressNetworkPolicy describes the current egress network policy for a Namespace. When using the &#x27;redhat/openshift-ovs-multitenant&#x27; network plugin, traffic from a pod to an IP address outside the cluster will be checked against each EgressNetworkPolicyRule in the pod&#x27;s namespace&#x27;s EgressNetworkPolicy, in order. If no rule matches (or no EgressNetworkPolicy is present) then the traffic will be allowed by default.
