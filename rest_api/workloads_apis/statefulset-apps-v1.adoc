Description::
  StatefulSet represents a set of pods with consistent identities. Identities are defined as:
 - Network: A single stable DNS and hostname.
 - Storage: As many VolumeClaims as requested.
The StatefulSet guarantees that a given network identity will always map to the same storage identity.

Type::
  `object`

| Property | Type | Description

| `.apiVersion`
| `string`
| APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources

| `.kind`
| `string`
| Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds

| `.metadata`

| `.spec`
| `object`
| A StatefulSetSpec is the specification of a StatefulSet.

| `.status`
| `object`
| StatefulSetStatus represents the current state of a StatefulSet.

..spec
Description::
  A StatefulSetSpec is the specification of a StatefulSet.

Type::
  `object`

Required::
  - `selector`
  - `template`
  - `serviceName`



[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `podManagementPolicy`
| `string`
| podManagementPolicy controls how pods are created during initial scale up, when replacing pods on nodes, or when scaling down. The default policy is `OrderedReady`, where pods are created in increasing order (pod-0, then pod-1, etc) and the controller will wait until each pod is ready before continuing. When scaling down, the pods are removed in the opposite order. The alternative policy is `Parallel` which will create pods in parallel to match the desired scale without waiting, and on scale down will delete all pods at once.

| `replicas`
| `integer`
| replicas is the desired number of replicas of the given Template. These are replicas in the sense that they are instantiations of the same Template, but individual replicas also have a consistent identity. If unspecified, defaults to 1.

| `revisionHistoryLimit`
| `integer`
| revisionHistoryLimit is the maximum number of revisions that will be maintained in the StatefulSet's revision history. The revision history consists of all revisions not represented by a currently applied StatefulSetSpec version. The default value is 10.

| `selector`
| xref:../objects/index.adoc#labelselector-meta-v1[`LabelSelector meta/v1`]
| selector is a label query over pods that should match the replica count. It must match the pod template's labels. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/#label-selectors

| `serviceName`
| `string`
| serviceName is the name of the service that governs this StatefulSet. This service must exist before the StatefulSet, and is responsible for the network identity of the set. Pods get DNS/hostnames that follow the pattern: pod-specific-string.serviceName.default.svc.cluster.local where "pod-specific-string" is managed by the StatefulSet controller.

| `template`
| xref:../objects/index.adoc#podtemplatespec-core-v1[`PodTemplateSpec core/v1`]
| template is the object that describes the pod that will be created if insufficient replicas are detected. Each pod stamped out by the StatefulSet will fulfill this Template, but have a unique identity from the rest of the StatefulSet.

| `updateStrategy`
| `object`
| StatefulSetUpdateStrategy indicates the strategy that the StatefulSet controller will use to perform updates. It includes any additional parameters necessary to perform the update for the indicated strategy.

| `volumeClaimTemplates`
| xref:../storage_apis/persistentvolumeclaim-core-v1.adoc#persistentvolumeclaim-core-v1[`array (PersistentVolumeClaim core/v1)`]
| volumeClaimTemplates is a list of claims that pods are allowed to reference. The StatefulSet controller is responsible for mapping network identities to claims in a way that maintains the identity of a pod. Every claim in this list must have at least one matching (by name) volumeMount in one container in the template. A claim in this list takes precedence over any volumes in the template, with the same name.

| Property | Type | Description

| `collisionCount`
| `integer`
| collisionCount is the count of hash collisions for the StatefulSet. The StatefulSet controller uses this field as a collision avoidance mechanism when it needs to create the name for the newest ControllerRevision.

| `conditions`
| `array`
| Represents the latest available observations of a statefulset's current state.

| `conditions[]`
| `object`
| StatefulSetCondition describes the state of a statefulset at a certain point.

| `currentReplicas`
| `integer`
| currentReplicas is the number of Pods created by the StatefulSet controller from the StatefulSet version indicated by currentRevision.

| `currentRevision`
| `string`
| currentRevision, if not empty, indicates the version of the StatefulSet used to generate Pods in the sequence [0,currentReplicas).

| `observedGeneration`
| `integer`
| observedGeneration is the most recent generation observed for this StatefulSet. It corresponds to the StatefulSet's generation, which is updated on mutation by the API Server.

| `readyReplicas`
| `integer`
| readyReplicas is the number of Pods created by the StatefulSet controller that have a Ready Condition.

| `replicas`
| `integer`
| replicas is the number of Pods created by the StatefulSet controller.

| `updateRevision`
| `string`
| updateRevision, if not empty, indicates the version of the StatefulSet used to generate Pods in the sequence [replicas-updatedReplicas,replicas)

| `updatedReplicas`
| `integer`
| updatedReplicas is the number of Pods created by the StatefulSet controller from the StatefulSet version indicated by updateRevision.
