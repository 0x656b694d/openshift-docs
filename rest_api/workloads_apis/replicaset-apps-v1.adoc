| `.kind`
| `string`
| Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds

| `.metadata`
| xref:../objects/index.adoc#objectmeta-meta-v1[`ObjectMeta meta/v1`]
| If the Labels of a ReplicaSet are empty, they are defaulted to be the same as the Pod(s) that the ReplicaSet manages. Standard object's metadata. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata

| `.spec`
| `object`
| ReplicaSetSpec is the specification of a ReplicaSet.

| `.status`
| `object`
| ReplicaSetStatus represents the current status of a ReplicaSet.

..spec
Description::
  ReplicaSetSpec is the specification of a ReplicaSet.

Type::
  `object`

Required::
  - `selector`



[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]

| Property | Type | Description

| `minReadySeconds`
| `integer`
| Minimum number of seconds for which a newly created pod should be ready without any of its container crashing, for it to be considered available. Defaults to 0 (pod will be considered available as soon as it is ready)

| `replicas`
| `integer`
| Replicas is the number of desired replicas. This is a pointer to distinguish between explicit zero and unspecified. Defaults to 1. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/replicationcontroller/#what-is-a-replicationcontroller

| `selector`
| xref:../objects/index.adoc#labelselector-meta-v1[`LabelSelector meta/v1`]
| Selector is a label query over pods that should match the replica count. Label keys and values that must match in order to be controlled by this replica set. It must match the pod template's labels. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/#label-selectors

| `template`
| xref:../objects/index.adoc#podtemplatespec-core-v1[`PodTemplateSpec core/v1`]
| Template is the object that describes the pod that will be created if insufficient replicas are detected. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/replicationcontroller#pod-template

| ReplicaSetCondition describes the state of a replica set at a certain point.

| `fullyLabeledReplicas`
| `integer`
| The number of pods that have labels matching the labels of the pod template of the replicaset.

| `observedGeneration`
| `integer`
| ObservedGeneration reflects the generation of the most recently observed ReplicaSet.

| `readyReplicas`
| `integer`
| The number of ready replicas for this replica set.

| `replicas`
| `integer`
| Replicas is the most recently oberved number of replicas. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/replicationcontroller/#what-is-a-replicationcontroller
