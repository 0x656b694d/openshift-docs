== Specification

[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `.apiVersion`
| `string`
| APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources

| `.kind`
| `string`
| Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds

| `.metadata`
| xref:../objects/index.adoc#objectmeta-meta-v1[`ObjectMeta meta/v1`]
| Standard object's metadata. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata

| `.spec`
| `object`
| DaemonSetSpec is the specification of a daemon set.

| `.status`
| `object`
| DaemonSetStatus represents the current status of a daemon set.

|===
..spec
Description::
  DaemonSetSpec is the specification of a daemon set.

Type::
  `object`

Required::
  - `selector`
  - `template`



[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `minReadySeconds`
| `integer`
| The minimum number of seconds for which a newly created DaemonSet pod should be ready without any of its container crashing, for it to be considered available. Defaults to 0 (pod will be considered available as soon as it is ready).

| `revisionHistoryLimit`
| `integer`
| The number of old history to retain to allow rollback. This is a pointer to distinguish between explicit zero and not specified. Defaults to 10.

| `selector`
| xref:../objects/index.adoc#labelselector-meta-v1[`LabelSelector meta/v1`]
| A label query over pods that are managed by the daemon set. Must match in order to be controlled. It must match the pod template's labels. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/#label-selectors

| `template`
| xref:../objects/index.adoc#podtemplatespec-core-v1[`PodTemplateSpec core/v1`]
| An object that describes the pod that will be created. The DaemonSet will create exactly one copy of this pod on every node that matches the template's node selector (or on every node if no node selector is specified). More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/replicationcontroller#pod-template

| `updateStrategy`
| `object`
| DaemonSetUpdateStrategy is a struct used to control the update strategy for a DaemonSet.

|===
..spec.updateStrategy
Description::
  DaemonSetUpdateStrategy is a struct used to control the update strategy for a DaemonSet.

Type::
  `object`




[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `rollingUpdate`
| `object`
| Spec to control the desired behavior of daemon set rolling update.

| `type`
| `string`
| Type of daemon set update. Can be "RollingUpdate" or "OnDelete". Default is RollingUpdate.

|===
..spec.updateStrategy.rollingUpdate
Description::
  Spec to control the desired behavior of daemon set rolling update.

Type::
  `object`




[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `maxUnavailable`
| xref:../objects/index.adoc#intorstring-util-intstr[`IntOrString util/intstr`]
| The maximum number of DaemonSet pods that can be unavailable during the update. Value can be an absolute number (ex: 5) or a percentage of total number of DaemonSet pods at the start of the update (ex: 10%). Absolute number is calculated from percentage by rounding up. This cannot be 0. Default value is 1. Example: when this is set to 30%, at most 30% of the total number of nodes that should be running the daemon pod (i.e. status.desiredNumberScheduled) can have their pods stopped for an update at any given time. The update starts by stopping at most 30% of those DaemonSet pods and then brings up new DaemonSet pods in their place. Once the new pods are available, it then proceeds onto other DaemonSet pods, thus ensuring that at least 70% of original number of DaemonSet pods are available at all times during the update.

|===
..status
Description::
  DaemonSetStatus represents the current status of a daemon set.

Type::
  `object`

Required::
  - `currentNumberScheduled`
  - `numberMisscheduled`
  - `desiredNumberScheduled`
  - `numberReady`



[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `collisionCount`
| `integer`
| Count of hash collisions for the DaemonSet. The DaemonSet controller uses this field as a collision avoidance mechanism when it needs to create the name for the newest ControllerRevision.

| `conditions`
| `array`
| Represents the latest available observations of a DaemonSet's current state.

| `conditions[]`
| `object`
| DaemonSetCondition describes the state of a DaemonSet at a certain point.

| `currentNumberScheduled`
| `integer`
| The number of nodes that are running at least 1 daemon pod and are supposed to run the daemon pod. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/daemonset/

| `desiredNumberScheduled`
| `integer`
| The total number of nodes that should be running the daemon pod (including nodes correctly running the daemon pod). More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/daemonset/

| `numberAvailable`
| `integer`
| The number of nodes that should be running the daemon pod and have one or more of the daemon pod running and available (ready for at least spec.minReadySeconds)

| `numberMisscheduled`
| `integer`
| The number of nodes that are running the daemon pod, but are not supposed to run the daemon pod. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/daemonset/

| `numberReady`
| `integer`
| The number of nodes that should be running the daemon pod and have one or more of the daemon pod running and ready.

| `numberUnavailable`
| `integer`
| The number of nodes that should be running the daemon pod and have none of the daemon pod running and available (ready for at least spec.minReadySeconds)
