Description::
  VolumeSnapshot is a user&#x27;s request for either creating a point-in-time snapshot of a persistent volume, or binding to a pre-existing snapshot.

Type::
  `object`

Required::
  - `spec`


== Specification

[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `.apiVersion`
| `string`
| APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources

| `.kind`
| `string`
| Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds

| `.metadata`
| xref:../objects/index.adoc#objectmeta-meta-v1[`ObjectMeta meta/v1`]
| Standard object's metadata. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata

| `.spec`
| `object`
| spec defines the desired characteristics of a snapshot requested by a user. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volume-snapshots#volumesnapshots Required.

| `.status`
| `object`
| status represents the current information of a snapshot. NOTE: status can be modified by sources other than system controllers, and must not be depended upon for accuracy. Controllers should only use information from the VolumeSnapshotContent object after verifying that the binding is accurate and complete.

..spec
Description::
  spec defines the desired characteristics of a snapshot requested by a user. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volume-snapshots#volumesnapshots Required.

Type::
  `object`

Required::
  - `source`



[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `source`
| `object`
| source specifies where a snapshot will be created from. This field is immutable after creation. Required.

| `volumeSnapshotClassName`
| `string`
| volumeSnapshotClassName is the name of the VolumeSnapshotClass requested by the VolumeSnapshot. If not specified, the default snapshot class will be used if one exists. If not specified, and there is no default snapshot class, dynamic snapshot creation will fail. Empty string is not allowed for this field. TODO(xiangqian): a webhook validation on empty string. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volume-snapshot-classes

|===
..spec.source
Description::
  source specifies where a snapshot will be created from. This field is immutable after creation. Required.

Type::
  `object`




[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `persistentVolumeClaimName`
| `string`
| persistentVolumeClaimName specifies the name of the PersistentVolumeClaim object in the same namespace as the VolumeSnapshot object where the snapshot should be dynamically taken from. This field is immutable.

| `volumeSnapshotContentName`
| `string`
| volumeSnapshotContentName specifies the name of a pre-existing VolumeSnapshotContent object. This field is immutable.

|===
..status
Description::
  status represents the current information of a snapshot. NOTE: status can be modified by sources other than system controllers, and must not be depended upon for accuracy. Controllers should only use information from the VolumeSnapshotContent object after verifying that the binding is accurate and complete.

Type::
  `object`




[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `boundVolumeSnapshotContentName`
| `string`
| boundVolumeSnapshotContentName represents the name of the VolumeSnapshotContent object to which the VolumeSnapshot object is bound. If not specified, it indicates that the VolumeSnapshot object has not been successfully bound to a VolumeSnapshotContent object yet. NOTE: Specified boundVolumeSnapshotContentName alone does not mean binding       is valid. Controllers MUST always verify bidirectional binding between       VolumeSnapshot and VolumeSnapshotContent to avoid possible security issues.

| `creationTime`
| `string`
| creationTime is the timestamp when the point-in-time snapshot is taken by the underlying storage system. In dynamic snapshot creation case, this field will be filled in with the "creation_time" value returned from CSI "CreateSnapshotRequest" gRPC call. For a pre-existing snapshot, this field will be filled with the "creation_time" value returned from the CSI "ListSnapshots" gRPC call if the driver supports it. If not specified, it indicates that the creation time of the snapshot is unknown.

| `error`
| `object`
| error is the last observed error during snapshot creation, if any. This field could be helpful to upper level controllers(i.e., application controller) to decide whether they should continue on waiting for the snapshot to be created based on the type of error reported.

| `readyToUse`
| `boolean`
| readyToUse indicates if a snapshot is ready to be used to restore a volume. In dynamic snapshot creation case, this field will be filled in with the "ready_to_use" value returned from CSI "CreateSnapshotRequest" gRPC call. For a pre-existing snapshot, this field will be filled with the "ready_to_use" value returned from the CSI "ListSnapshots" gRPC call if the driver supports it, otherwise, this field will be set to "True". If not specified, it means the readiness of a snapshot is unknown.

| `restoreSize`
| `integer-or-string`
| restoreSize represents the complete size of the snapshot in bytes. In dynamic snapshot creation case, this field will be filled in with the "size_bytes" value returned from CSI "CreateSnapshotRequest" gRPC call. For a pre-existing snapshot, this field will be filled with the "size_bytes" value returned from the CSI "ListSnapshots" gRPC call if the driver supports it. When restoring a volume from this snapshot, the size of the volume MUST NOT be smaller than the restoreSize if it is specified, otherwise the restoration will fail. If not specified, it indicates that the size is unknown.

|===
..status.error
Description::
  error is the last observed error during snapshot creation, if any. This field could be helpful to upper level controllers(i.e., application controller) to decide whether they should continue on waiting for the snapshot to be created based on the type of error reported.

Type::
  `object`




[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `message`
| `string`
| message is a string detailing the encountered error during snapshot creation if specified. NOTE: message may be logged, and it should not contain sensitive information.

| `time`
| `string`
| time is the timestamp when the error was encountered.
