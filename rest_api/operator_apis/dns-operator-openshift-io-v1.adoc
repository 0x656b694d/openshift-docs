Description::
  DNS manages the CoreDNS component to provide a name resolution service for pods and services in the cluster. 
 This supports the DNS-based service discovery specification: https://github.com/kubernetes/dns/blob/master/docs/specification.md 
 More details: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/coredns

Type::
  `object`



== Specification

[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `.apiVersion`
| `string`
| APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources

| `.kind`
| `string`
| Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds

| `.metadata`
| xref:../objects/index.adoc#objectmeta-meta-v1[`ObjectMeta meta/v1`]
| Standard object's metadata. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata

| `.spec`
| `object`
| spec is the specification of the desired behavior of the DNS.

| `.status`
| `object`
| status is the most recently observed status of the DNS.

  spec is the specification of the desired behavior of the DNS.

  `object`




[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `servers`
| `array`
| servers is a list of DNS resolvers that provide name query delegation for one or more subdomains outside the scope of the cluster domain. If servers consists of more than one Server, longest suffix match will be used to determine the Server. 
 For example, if there are two Servers, one for "foo.com" and another for "a.foo.com", and the name query is for "www.a.foo.com", it will be routed to the Server with Zone "a.foo.com". 
 If this field is nil, no servers are created.

| `servers[]`
| `object`
| Server defines the schema for a server that runs per instance of CoreDNS.

|===
..spec.servers
Description::
  servers is a list of DNS resolvers that provide name query delegation for one or more subdomains outside the scope of the cluster domain. If servers consists of more than one Server, longest suffix match will be used to determine the Server. 
 For example, if there are two Servers, one for &quot;foo.com&quot; and another for &quot;a.foo.com&quot;, and the name query is for &quot;www.a.foo.com&quot;, it will be routed to the Server with Zone &quot;a.foo.com&quot;. 
 If this field is nil, no servers are created.

| Property | Type | Description

| `forwardPlugin`
| `object`
| forwardPlugin defines a schema for configuring CoreDNS to proxy DNS messages to upstream resolvers.

| `name`
| `string`
| name is required and specifies a unique name for the server. Name must comply with the Service Name Syntax of rfc6335.

| `zones`
| `array (string)`
| zones is required and specifies the subdomains that Server is authoritative for. Zones must conform to the rfc1123 definition of a subdomain. Specifying the cluster domain (i.e., "cluster.local") is invalid.

..spec.servers[].forwardPlugin
Description::
  forwardPlugin defines a schema for configuring CoreDNS to proxy DNS messages to upstream resolvers.

Type::
  `object`




[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `upstreams`
| `array (string)`
| upstreams is a list of resolvers to forward name queries for subdomains of Zones. Upstreams are randomized when more than 1 upstream is specified. Each instance of CoreDNS performs health checking of Upstreams. When a healthy upstream returns an error during the exchange, another resolver is tried from Upstreams. Each upstream is represented by an IP address or IP:port if the upstream listens on a port other than 53. 
 A maximum of 15 upstreams is allowed per ForwardPlugin.

|===
..status
Description::
  status is the most recently observed status of the DNS.

Type::
  `object`

Required::
  - `clusterDomain`
  - `clusterIP`



[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `clusterDomain`
| `string`
| clusterDomain is the local cluster DNS domain suffix for DNS services. This will be a subdomain as defined in RFC 1034, section 3.5: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1034#section-3.5 Example: "cluster.local" 
 More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/dns-pod-service

| `clusterIP`
| `string`
| clusterIP is the service IP through which this DNS is made available. 
 In the case of the default DNS, this will be a well known IP that is used as the default nameserver for pods that are using the default ClusterFirst DNS policy. 
 In general, this IP can be specified in a pod's spec.dnsConfig.nameservers list or used explicitly when performing name resolution from within the cluster. Example: dig foo.com @<service IP> 
 More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#virtual-ips-and-service-proxies

| `conditions`
| `array`
| conditions provide information about the state of the DNS on the cluster. 
 These are the supported DNS conditions: 
   * Available   - True if the following conditions are met:     * DNS controller daemonset is available.   - False if any of those conditions are unsatisfied.

| `conditions[]`
| `object`
| OperatorCondition is just the standard condition fields.
