| Property | Type | Description

| `.apiVersion`
| `string`
| APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources

| `.kind`
| `string`
| Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds

| `.metadata`
| xref:../objects/index.adoc#objectmeta-meta-v1[`ObjectMeta meta/v1`]
| Standard object's metadata. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata

| `.spec`
| `object`
| ConsoleSpec is the specification of the desired behavior of the Console.

| `.status`
| `object`
| ConsoleStatus defines the observed status of the Console.

Description::
  ConsoleSpec is the specification of the desired behavior of the Console.

| Property | Type | Description

| `customization`
| `object`
| customization is used to optionally provide a small set of customization options to the web console.

| `logLevel`
| `string`
| logLevel is an intent based logging for an overall component.  It does not give fine grained control, but it is a simple way to manage coarse grained logging choices that operators have to interpret for their operands.

| `managementState`
| `string`
| managementState indicates whether and how the operator should manage the component

| `observedConfig`
| ``
| observedConfig holds a sparse config that controller has observed from the cluster state.  It exists in spec because it is an input to the level for the operator

| `operatorLogLevel`
| `string`
| operatorLogLevel is an intent based logging for the operator itself.  It does not give fine grained control, but it is a simple way to manage coarse grained logging choices that operators have to interpret for themselves.

| `providers`
| `object`
| providers contains configuration for using specific service providers.

| `route`
| `object`
| route contains hostname and secret reference that contains the serving certificate. If a custom route is specified, a new route will be created with the provided hostname, under which console will be available. In case of custom hostname uses the default routing suffix of the cluster, the Secret specification for a serving certificate will not be needed. In case of custom hostname points to an arbitrary domain, manual DNS configurations steps are necessary. The default console route will be maintained to reserve the default hostname for console if the custom route is removed. If not specified, default route will be used.

| `unsupportedConfigOverrides`
| ``
| unsupportedConfigOverrides holds a sparse config that will override any previously set options.  It only needs to be the fields to override it will end up overlaying in the following order: 1. hardcoded defaults 2. observedConfig 3. unsupportedConfigOverrides

This can be created with a command like 'oc create configmap custom-logo --from-file=/path/to/file -n openshift-config'. Image size must be less than 1 MB due to constraints on the ConfigMap size. The ConfigMap key should include a file extension so that the console serves the file with the correct MIME type. Recommended logo specifications: Dimensions: Max height of 68px and max width of 200px SVG format preferred

| `customProductName`
| `string`
| customProductName is the name that will be displayed in page titles, logo alt text, and the about dialog instead of the normal OpenShift product name.

| `documentationBaseURL`
