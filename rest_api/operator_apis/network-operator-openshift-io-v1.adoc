| Property | Type | Description

| `.apiVersion`
| `string`
| APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources

| `.kind`
| `string`
| Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds

| `.metadata`
| xref:../objects/index.adoc#objectmeta-meta-v1[`ObjectMeta meta/v1`]

| `.spec`
| `object`
| NetworkSpec is the top-level network configuration object.

| `array`
| additionalNetworks is a list of extra networks to make available to pods when multiple networks are enabled.

| `additionalNetworks[]`
| `object`
| AdditionalNetworkDefinition configures an extra network that is available but not created by default. Instead, pods must request them by name. type must be specified, along with exactly one "Config" that matches the type.

| `clusterNetwork`
| `array`
| clusterNetwork is the IP address pool to use for pod IPs. Some network providers, e.g. OpenShift SDN, support multiple ClusterNetworks. Others only support one. This is equivalent to the cluster-cidr.

| `clusterNetwork[]`
| `object`
| ClusterNetworkEntry is a subnet from which to allocate PodIPs. A network of size HostPrefix (in CIDR notation) will be allocated when nodes join the cluster. Not all network providers support multiple ClusterNetworks

| `defaultNetwork`
| `object`

| `deployKubeProxy`
| `boolean`
| deployKubeProxy specifies whether or not a standalone kube-proxy should be deployed by the operator. Some network providers include kube-proxy or similar functionality. If unset, the plugin will attempt to select the correct value, which is false when OpenShift SDN and ovn-kubernetes are used and true otherwise.

| `disableMultiNetwork`
| `boolean`
| disableMultiNetwork specifies whether or not multiple pod network support should be disabled. If unset, this property defaults to 'false' and multiple network support is enabled.

| `kubeProxyConfig`
| `object`
| kubeProxyConfig lets us configure desired proxy configuration. If not specified, sensible defaults will be chosen by OpenShift directly. Not consumed by all network providers - currently only openshift-sdn.

| `logLevel`
| `string`
| logLevel allows configuring the logging level of the components deployed by the operator. Currently only Kuryr SDN is affected by this setting. Please note that turning on extensive logging may affect performance. The default value is "Normal".

| `serviceNetwork`
| `array (string)`
| serviceNetwork is the ip address pool to use for Service IPs Currently, all existing network providers only support a single value here, but this is an array to allow for growth.

[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `controllerProbesPort`
| `integer`
| The port kuryr-controller will listen for readiness and liveness requests.

| `daemonProbesPort`
| `integer`
| The port kuryr-daemon will listen for readiness and liveness requests.

| `enablePortPoolsPrepopulation`
| `boolean`
| enablePortPoolsPrepopulation when true will make Kuryr prepopulate each newly created port pool with a minimum number of ports. Kuryr uses Neutron port pooling to fight the fact that it takes a significant amount of time to create one. Instead of creating it when pod is being deployed, Kuryr keeps a number of ports ready to be attached to pods. By default port prepopulation is disabled.

| `openStackServiceNetwork`
| `string`
| openStackServiceNetwork contains the CIDR of network from which to allocate IPs for OpenStack Octavia's Amphora VMs. Please note that with Amphora driver Octavia uses two IPs from that network for each loadbalancer - one given by OpenShift and second for VRRP connections. As the first one is managed by OpenShift's and second by Neutron's IPAMs, those need to come from different pools. Therefore `openStackServiceNetwork` needs to be at least twice the size of `serviceNetwork`, and whole `serviceNetwork` must be overlapping with `openStackServiceNetwork`. cluster-network-operator will then make sure VRRP IPs are taken from the ranges inside `openStackServiceNetwork` that are not overlapping with `serviceNetwork`, effectivly preventing conflicts. If not set cluster-network-operator will use `serviceNetwork` expanded by decrementing the prefix size by 1.

| `poolBatchPorts`
| `integer`
| poolBatchPorts sets a number of ports that should be created in a single batch request to extend the port pool. The default is 3. For more information about port pools see enablePortPoolsPrepopulation setting.

| `poolMaxPorts`
| `integer`
| poolMaxPorts sets a maximum number of free ports that are being kept in a port pool. If the number of ports exceeds this setting, free ports will get deleted. Setting 0 will disable this upper bound, effectively preventing pools from shrinking and this is the default value. For more information about port pools see enablePortPoolsPrepopulation setting.

| `poolMinPorts`
| `integer`
| poolMinPorts sets a minimum number of free ports that should be kept in a port pool. If the number of ports is lower than this setting, new ports will get created and added to pool. The default is 1. For more information about port pools see enablePortPoolsPrepopulation setting.
