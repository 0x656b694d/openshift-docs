Description::
  IngressController describes a managed ingress controller for the cluster. The controller can service OpenShift Route and Kubernetes Ingress resources. 
 When an IngressController is created, a new ingress controller deployment is created to allow external traffic to reach the services that expose Ingress or Route resources. Updating this resource may lead to disruption for public facing network connections as a new ingress controller revision may be rolled out. 
 https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress-controllers 
 Whenever possible, sensible defaults for the platform are used. See each field for more details.

| Property | Type | Description

| `defaultCertificate`
| `object`
| defaultCertificate is a reference to a secret containing the default certificate served by the ingress controller. When Routes don't specify their own certificate, defaultCertificate is used. 
 The secret must contain the following keys and data: 
   tls.crt: certificate file contents   tls.key: key file contents 
 If unset, a wildcard certificate is automatically generated and used. The certificate is valid for the ingress controller domain (and subdomains) and the generated certificate's CA will be automatically integrated with the cluster's trust store. 
 The in-use certificate (whether generated or user-specified) will be automatically integrated with OpenShift's built-in OAuth server.

| `domain`
| `string`
| domain is a DNS name serviced by the ingress controller and is used to configure multiple features: 
 * For the LoadBalancerService endpoint publishing strategy, domain is   used to configure DNS records. See endpointPublishingStrategy. 
 * When using a generated default certificate, the certificate will be valid   for domain and its subdomains. See defaultCertificate. 
 * The value is published to individual Route statuses so that end-users   know where to target external DNS records. 
 domain must be unique among all IngressControllers, and cannot be updated. 
 If empty, defaults to ingress.config.openshift.io/cluster .spec.domain.

| `endpointPublishingStrategy`
| `object`
| endpointPublishingStrategy is used to publish the ingress controller endpoints to other networks, enable load balancer integrations, etc. 
 If unset, the default is based on infrastructure.config.openshift.io/cluster .status.platform: 
   AWS:      LoadBalancerService (with External scope)   Azure:    LoadBalancerService (with External scope)   GCP:      LoadBalancerService (with External scope)   IBMCloud: LoadBalancerService (with External scope)   Libvirt:  HostNetwork 
 Any other platform types (including None) default to HostNetwork. 
 endpointPublishingStrategy cannot be updated.

| `namespaceSelector`
| `object`
| namespaceSelector is used to filter the set of namespaces serviced by the ingress controller. This is useful for implementing shards. 
 If unset, the default is no filtering.

| `nodePlacement`
| `object`
| nodePlacement enables explicit control over the scheduling of the ingress controller. 
 If unset, defaults are used. See NodePlacement for more details.

| `replicas`
| `integer`
| replicas is the desired number of ingress controller replicas. If unset, defaults to 2.

| `routeAdmission`
| `object`
| routeAdmission defines a policy for handling new route claims (for example, to allow or deny claims across namespaces). 
 If empty, defaults will be applied. See specific routeAdmission fields for details about their defaults.

| `routeSelector`
| `object`
| routeSelector is used to filter the set of Routes serviced by the ingress controller. This is useful for implementing shards. 
 If unset, the default is no filtering.

| `tlsSecurityProfile`
| `object`
| tlsSecurityProfile specifies settings for TLS connections for ingresscontrollers. 
 If unset, the default is based on the apiservers.config.openshift.io/cluster resource. 
 Note that when using the Old, Intermediate, and Modern profile types, the effective profile configuration is subject to change between releases. For example, given a specification to use the Intermediate profile deployed on release X.Y.Z, an upgrade to release X.Y.Z+1 may cause a new profile configuration to be applied to the ingress controller, resulting in a rollout. 
 Note that the minimum TLS version for ingress controllers is 1.1, and the maximum TLS version is 1.2.  An implication of this restriction is that the Modern TLS profile type cannot be used because it requires TLS 1.3.

| `type`
| `string`
| type is the publishing strategy to use. Valid values are: 
 * LoadBalancerService 
 Publishes the ingress controller using a Kubernetes LoadBalancer Service. 
 In this configuration, the ingress controller deployment uses container networking. A LoadBalancer Service is created to publish the deployment. 
 See: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#loadbalancer 
 If domain is set, a wildcard DNS record will be managed to point at the LoadBalancer Service's external name. DNS records are managed only in DNS zones defined by dns.config.openshift.io/cluster .spec.publicZone and .spec.privateZone. 
 Wildcard DNS management is currently supported only on the AWS, Azure, and GCP platforms. 
 * HostNetwork 
 Publishes the ingress controller on node ports where the ingress controller is deployed. 
 In this configuration, the ingress controller deployment uses host networking, bound to node ports 80 and 443. The user is responsible for configuring an external load balancer to publish the ingress controller via the node ports. 
 * Private 
 Does not publish the ingress controller. 
 In this configuration, the ingress controller deployment uses container networking, and is not explicitly published. The user must manually publish the ingress controller. 
 * NodePortService 
 Publishes the ingress controller using a Kubernetes NodePort Service. 
 In this configuration, the ingress controller deployment uses container networking. A NodePort Service is created to publish the deployment. The specific node ports are dynamically allocated by OpenShift; however, to support static port allocations, user changes to the node port field of the managed NodePort Service will preserved.

| private holds parameters for the Private endpoint publishing strategy. Present only if type is Private.

| `type`
| `string`
| type is the publishing strategy to use. Valid values are: 
 * LoadBalancerService 
 Publishes the ingress controller using a Kubernetes LoadBalancer Service. 
 In this configuration, the ingress controller deployment uses container networking. A LoadBalancer Service is created to publish the deployment. 
 See: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#loadbalancer 
 If domain is set, a wildcard DNS record will be managed to point at the LoadBalancer Service's external name. DNS records are managed only in DNS zones defined by dns.config.openshift.io/cluster .spec.publicZone and .spec.privateZone. 
 Wildcard DNS management is currently supported only on the AWS, Azure, and GCP platforms. 
 * HostNetwork 
 Publishes the ingress controller on node ports where the ingress controller is deployed. 
 In this configuration, the ingress controller deployment uses host networking, bound to node ports 80 and 443. The user is responsible for configuring an external load balancer to publish the ingress controller via the node ports. 
 * Private 
 Does not publish the ingress controller. 
 In this configuration, the ingress controller deployment uses container networking, and is not explicitly published. The user must manually publish the ingress controller. 
 * NodePortService 
 Publishes the ingress controller using a Kubernetes NodePort Service. 
 In this configuration, the ingress controller deployment uses container networking. A NodePort Service is created to publish the deployment. The specific node ports are dynamically allocated by OpenShift; however, to support static port allocations, user changes to the node port field of the managed NodePort Service will preserved.

| Property | Type | Description

| `ciphers`
| `array (string)`
| ciphers is used to specify the cipher algorithms that are negotiated during the TLS handshake.  Operators may remove entries their operands do not support.  For example, to use DES-CBC3-SHA  (yaml): 
   ciphers:     - DES-CBC3-SHA

| `minTLSVersion`
| `string`
| minTLSVersion is used to specify the minimal version of the TLS protocol that is negotiated during the TLS handshake. For example, to use TLS versions 1.1, 1.2 and 1.3 (yaml): 
   minTLSVersion: TLSv1.1 
 NOTE: currently the highest minTLSVersion allowed is VersionTLS12
