| Property | Type | Description

| `.apiVersion`
| `string`
| APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources

| `.kind`
| `string`
| Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds

| `.metadata`
| xref:../objects/index.adoc#objectmeta-meta-v1[`ObjectMeta meta/v1`]
| Standard object's metadata. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata

| `.spec`
| `object`
| ConfigSpec contains the desired configuration and state for the Samples Operator, controlling various behavior around the imagestreams and templates it creates/updates in the openshift namespace.

| `.status`
| `object`
| ConfigStatus contains the actual configuration in effect, as well as various details that describe the state of the Samples Operator.

  ConfigSpec contains the desired configuration and state for the Samples Operator, controlling various behavior around the imagestreams and templates it creates/updates in the openshift namespace.

Type::
  `object`




[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `architectures`
| `array (string)`
| architectures determine which hardware architecture(s) to install, where x86_64, ppc64le, and s390x are the only supported choices currently.

| `managementState`
| `string`
| managementState is top level on/off type of switch for all operators. When "Managed", this operator processes config and manipulates the samples accordingly. When "Unmanaged", this operator ignores any updates to the resources it watches. When "Removed", it reacts that same wasy as it does if the Config object is deleted, meaning any ImageStreams or Templates it manages (i.e. it honors the skipped lists) and the registry secret are deleted, along with the ConfigMap in the operator's namespace that represents the last config used to manipulate the samples,

| `samplesRegistry`
| `string`
| samplesRegistry allows for the specification of which registry is accessed by the ImageStreams for their image content.  Defaults on the content in https://github.com/openshift/library that are pulled into this github repository, but based on our pulling only ocp content it typically defaults to registry.redhat.io.

| `skippedImagestreams`
| `array (string)`
| skippedImagestreams specifies names of image streams that should NOT be created/updated.  Admins can use this to allow them to delete content they don’t want.  They will still have to manually delete the content but the operator will not recreate(or update) anything listed here.

| `skippedTemplates`
| `array (string)`
| skippedTemplates specifies names of templates that should NOT be created/updated.  Admins can use this to allow them to delete content they don’t want.  They will still have to manually delete the content but the operator will not recreate(or update) anything listed here.

Description::
  ConfigStatus contains the actual configuration in effect, as well as various details that describe the state of the Samples Operator.

| Property | Type | Description

| `architectures`
| `array (string)`
| architectures determine which hardware architecture(s) to install, where x86_64 and ppc64le are the supported choices.

| `conditions`
| `array`
| conditions represents the available maintenance status of the sample imagestreams and templates.

| `conditions[]`
| `object`
| ConfigCondition captures various conditions of the Config as entries are processed.

| `managementState`
| `string`
| managementState reflects the current operational status of the on/off switch for the operator.  This operator compares the ManagementState as part of determining that we are turning the operator back on (i.e. "Managed") when it was previously "Unmanaged".

| `samplesRegistry`
| `string`
| samplesRegistry allows for the specification of which registry is accessed by the ImageStreams for their image content.  Defaults on the content in https://github.com/openshift/library that are pulled into this github repository, but based on our pulling only ocp content it typically defaults to registry.redhat.io.

| `version`
| `string`
| version is the value of the operator's payload based version indicator when it was last successfully processed
