| `providerID`
| `string`
| ID of the node assigned by the cloud provider in the format: <ProviderName>://<ProviderSpecificNodeID>

| `taints`

| If specified, the node's taints.

| `unschedulable`
| `boolean`
| Unschedulable controls node schedulability of new pods. By default, node is schedulable. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/nodes/node/#manual-node-administration

| Property | Type | Description

| `addresses`
| xref:../objects/index.adoc#nodeaddress-core-v1[`array (NodeAddress core/v1)`]
| List of addresses reachable to the node. Queried from cloud provider, if available. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/nodes/node/#addresses Note: This field is declared as mergeable, but the merge key is not sufficiently unique, which can cause data corruption when it is merged. Callers should instead use a full-replacement patch. See http://pr.k8s.io/79391 for an example.

| `allocatable`
| xref:../objects/index.adoc#quantity-api-resource[`object (Quantity api/resource)`]
| Allocatable represents the resources of a node that are available for scheduling. Defaults to Capacity.

| `capacity`
| xref:../objects/index.adoc#quantity-api-resource[`object (Quantity api/resource)`]
| Capacity represents the total resources of a node. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes#capacity

| `conditions`
| xref:../objects/index.adoc#nodecondition-core-v1[`array (NodeCondition core/v1)`]
| Conditions is an array of current observed node conditions. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/nodes/node/#condition

| `config`
| `object`
| NodeConfigStatus describes the status of the config assigned by Node.Spec.ConfigSource.

| `daemonEndpoints`
| xref:../objects/index.adoc#nodedaemonendpoints-core-v1[`NodeDaemonEndpoints core/v1`]

| `string`
| NodePhase is the recently observed lifecycle phase of the node. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/nodes/node/#phase The field is never populated, and now is deprecated.

..status.config
Description::
  NodeConfigStatus describes the status of the config assigned by Node.Spec.ConfigSource.

Type::
  `object`




[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `active`
| xref:../objects/index.adoc#nodeconfigsource-core-v1[`NodeConfigSource core/v1`]
| Active reports the checkpointed config the node is actively using. Active will represent either the current version of the Assigned config, or the current LastKnownGood config, depending on whether attempting to use the Assigned config results in an error.

| `assigned`
| xref:../objects/index.adoc#nodeconfigsource-core-v1[`NodeConfigSource core/v1`]
| Assigned reports the checkpointed config the node will try to use. When Node.Spec.ConfigSource is updated, the node checkpoints the associated config payload to local disk, along with a record indicating intended config. The node refers to this record to choose its config checkpoint, and reports this record in Assigned. Assigned only updates in the status after the record has been checkpointed to disk. When the Kubelet is restarted, it tries to make the Assigned config the Active config by loading and validating the checkpointed payload identified by Assigned.

| `error`
| `string`
| Error describes any problems reconciling the Spec.ConfigSource to the Active config. Errors may occur, for example, attempting to checkpoint Spec.ConfigSource to the local Assigned record, attempting to checkpoint the payload associated with Spec.ConfigSource, attempting to load or validate the Assigned config, etc. Errors may occur at different points while syncing config. Earlier errors (e.g. download or checkpointing errors) will not result in a rollback to LastKnownGood, and may resolve across Kubelet retries. Later errors (e.g. loading or validating a checkpointed config) will result in a rollback to LastKnownGood. In the latter case, it is usually possible to resolve the error by fixing the config assigned in Spec.ConfigSource. You can find additional information for debugging by searching the error message in the Kubelet log. Error is a human-readable description of the error state; machines can check whether or not Error is empty, but should not rely on the stability of the Error text across Kubelet versions.

| `lastKnownGood`
| xref:../objects/index.adoc#nodeconfigsource-core-v1[`NodeConfigSource core/v1`]
| LastKnownGood reports the checkpointed config the node will fall back to when it encounters an error attempting to use the Assigned config. The Assigned config becomes the LastKnownGood config when the node determines that the Assigned config is stable and correct. This is currently implemented as a 10-minute soak period starting when the local record of Assigned config is updated. If the Assigned config is Active at the end of this period, it becomes the LastKnownGood. Note that if Spec.ConfigSource is reset to nil (use local defaults), the LastKnownGood is also immediately reset to nil, because the local default config is always assumed good. You should not make assumptions about the node's method of determining config stability and correctness, as this may change or become configurable in the future.
