Description::
  Tuned is a collection of rules that allows cluster-wide deployment of node-level sysctls and more flexibility to add custom tuning specified by user needs. These rules are translated and passed to all containerized tuned daemons running in the cluster in the format that the daemons understand. The responsibility for applying the node-level tuning then lies with the containerized tuned daemons. More info: https://github.com/openshift/cluster-node-tuning-operator

| Property | Type | Description

| `machineConfigLabels`
| `object (string)`
| MachineConfigLabels specifies the labels for a MachineConfig. The MachineConfig is created automatically to apply additional host settings (e.g. kernel boot parameters) profile 'Profile' needs and can only be applied by creating a MachineConfig. This involves finding all MachineConfigPools with machineConfigSelector matching the MachineConfigLabels and setting the profile 'Profile' on all nodes that match the MachineConfigPools' nodeSelectors.

| `match`
| `array`
| Rules governing application of a tuned profile connected by logical OR operator.

| `match[]`
| `object`
| Rules governing application of a tuned profile.

| `priority`
| `integer`
| Tuned profile priority. Highest priority is 0.

| `profile`
| `string`
| Name of the tuned profile to recommend.

| 

| `type`
| `string`
| Match type: [node/pod]. If omitted, "node" is assumed.

| `value`
| `string`
| Node or Pod label value. If omitted, the presence of label name is enough to match.
