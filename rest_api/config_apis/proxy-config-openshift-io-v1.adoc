| Property | Type | Description

| `.apiVersion`
| `string`
| APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources

| `.kind`
| `string`
| Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds

| `.metadata`
| xref:../objects/index.adoc#objectmeta-meta-v1[`ObjectMeta meta/v1`]
| Standard object's metadata. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata

| `.spec`
| `object`
| Spec holds user-settable values for the proxy configuration

| `.status`
| `object`
| status holds observed values from the cluster. They may not be overridden.

| Property | Type | Description

| `httpProxy`
| `string`
| httpProxy is the URL of the proxy for HTTP requests.  Empty means unset and will not result in an env var.

| `httpsProxy`
| `string`
| httpsProxy is the URL of the proxy for HTTPS requests.  Empty means unset and will not result in an env var.

| `noProxy`
| `string`
| noProxy is a comma-separated list of hostnames and/or CIDRs for which the proxy should not be used. Empty means unset and will not result in an env var.

| `readinessEndpoints`
| `array (string)`
| readinessEndpoints is a list of endpoints used to verify readiness of the proxy.

| `trustedCA`
| `object`
| trustedCA is a reference to a ConfigMap containing a CA certificate bundle. The trustedCA field should only be consumed by a proxy validator. The validator is responsible for reading the certificate bundle from the required key "ca-bundle.crt", merging it with the system default trust bundle, and writing the merged trust bundle to a ConfigMap named "trusted-ca-bundle" in the "openshift-config-managed" namespace. Clients that expect to make proxy connections must use the trusted-ca-bundle for all HTTPS requests to the proxy, and may use the trusted-ca-bundle for non-proxy HTTPS requests as well. 
 The namespace for the ConfigMap referenced by trustedCA is "openshift-config". Here is an example ConfigMap (in yaml): 
 apiVersion: v1 kind: ConfigMap metadata:  name: user-ca-bundle  namespace: openshift-config  data:    ca-bundle.crt: \|      -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----      Custom CA certificate bundle.      -----END CERTIFICATE-----
