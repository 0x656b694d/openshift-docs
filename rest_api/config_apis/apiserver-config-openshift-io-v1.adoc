Description::
  APIServer holds configuration (like serving certificates, client CA and CORS domains) shared by all API servers in the system, among them especially kube-apiserver and openshift-apiserver. The canonical name of an instance is &#x27;cluster&#x27;.

Type::
  `object`

Required::
  - `spec`


== Specification

[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `.apiVersion`
| `string`
| APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources

| `.kind`
| `string`
| Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds

| `.metadata`
| xref:../objects/index.adoc#objectmeta-meta-v1[`ObjectMeta meta/v1`]
| Standard object's metadata. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata

| `.spec`
| `object`
| spec holds user settable values for configuration

| `.status`
| `object`
| status holds observed values from the cluster. They may not be overridden.

..spec
Description::
  spec holds user settable values for configuration

Type::
  `object`




[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `additionalCORSAllowedOrigins`
| `array (string)`
| additionalCORSAllowedOrigins lists additional, user-defined regular expressions describing hosts for which the API server allows access using the CORS headers. This may be needed to access the API and the integrated OAuth server from JavaScript applications. The values are regular expressions that correspond to the Golang regular expression language.

| `clientCA`
| `object`
| clientCA references a ConfigMap containing a certificate bundle for the signers that will be recognized for incoming client certificates in addition to the operator managed signers. If this is empty, then only operator managed signers are valid. You usually only have to set this if you have your own PKI you wish to honor client certificates from. The ConfigMap must exist in the openshift-config namespace and contain the following required fields: - ConfigMap.Data["ca-bundle.crt"] - CA bundle.

| `encryption`
| `object`
| encryption allows the configuration of encryption of resources at the datastore layer.

| `servingCerts`
| `object`
| servingCert is the TLS cert info for serving secure traffic. If not specified, operator managed certificates will be used for serving secure traffic.

| `tlsSecurityProfile`
| `object`
| tlsSecurityProfile specifies settings for TLS connections for externally exposed servers. 
 If unset, a default (which may change between releases) is chosen. Note that only Old and Intermediate profiles are currently supported, and the maximum available MinTLSVersions is VersionTLS12.

| Property | Type | Description

..spec.encryption
Description::
  encryption allows the configuration of encryption of resources at the datastore layer.

Type::
  `object`




[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `type`
| `string`
| type defines what encryption type should be used to encrypt resources at the datastore layer. When this field is unset (i.e. when it is set to the empty string), identity is implied. The behavior of unset can and will change over time.  Even if encryption is enabled by default, the meaning of unset may change to a different encryption type based on changes in best practices. 
 When encryption is enabled, all sensitive resources shipped with the platform are encrypted. This list of sensitive resources can and will change over time.  The current authoritative list is: 
   1. secrets   2. configmaps   3. routes.route.openshift.io   4. oauthaccesstokens.oauth.openshift.io   5. oauthauthorizetokens.oauth.openshift.io

| Property | Type | Description

| `names`
| `array (string)`
| names is a optional list of explicit DNS names (leading wildcards allowed) that should use this certificate to serve secure traffic. If no names are provided, the implicit names will be extracted from the certificates. Exact names trump over wildcard names. Explicit names defined here trump over extracted implicit names.

| `servingCertificate`
| `object`
| servingCertificate references a kubernetes.io/tls type secret containing the TLS cert info for serving secure traffic. The secret must exist in the openshift-config namespace and contain the following required fields: - Secret.Data["tls.key"] - TLS private key. - Secret.Data["tls.crt"] - TLS certificate.

| `type`
| `string`
| type is one of Old, Intermediate, Modern or Custom. Custom provides the ability to specify individual TLS security profile parameters. Old, Intermediate and Modern are TLS security profiles based on: 
 https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Server_Side_TLS#Recommended_configurations 
 The profiles are intent based, so they may change over time as new ciphers are developed and existing ciphers are found to be insecure.  Depending on precisely which ciphers are available to a process, the list may be reduced. 
 Note that the Modern profile is currently not supported because it is not yet well adopted by common software libraries.
