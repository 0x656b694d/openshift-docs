Description::
  ClusterOperator is the Custom Resource object which holds the current state of an operator. This object is used by operators to convey their state to the rest of the cluster.

Type::
  `object`

Required::
  - `spec`


== Specification

[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `.apiVersion`
| `string`
| APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources

| `.kind`
| `string`
| Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds

| `.metadata`
| xref:../objects/index.adoc#objectmeta-meta-v1[`ObjectMeta meta/v1`]
| Standard object's metadata. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata

| `.spec`
| `object`
| spec hold the intent of how this operator should behave.

| `.status`
| `object`
| status holds the information about the state of an operator.  It is consistent with status information across the kube ecosystem.

| Property | Type | Description

| `conditions`
| `array`
| conditions describes the state of the operator's reconciliation functionality.

| `conditions[]`
| `object`
| ClusterOperatorStatusCondition represents the state of the operator's reconciliation functionality.

| `extension`
| ``
| extension contains any additional status information specific to the operator which owns this status object.

| `relatedObjects`
| `array`
| relatedObjects is a list of objects that are "interesting" or related to this operator.  Common uses are: 1. the detailed resource driving the operator 2. operator namespaces 3. operand namespaces

| `relatedObjects[]`
| `object`
| ObjectReference contains enough information to let you inspect or modify the referred object.

| `versions`
| `array`
| versions is a slice of operand version tuples.  Operators which manage multiple operands will have multiple entries in the array.  If an operator is Available, it must have at least one entry.  You must report the version of the operator itself with the name "operator".

| Property | Type | Description

| `lastTransitionTime`
| `string`
| lastTransitionTime is the time of the last update to the current status object.

| `message`

| message provides additional information about the current condition. This is only to be consumed by humans.

| `reason`
| `string`
| reason is the reason for the condition's last transition.  Reasons are CamelCase

| `status`
| `string`
| status of the condition, one of True, False, Unknown.

| `type`
| `string`
| type specifies the state of the operator's reconciliation functionality.

..status.versions
Description::
  versions is a slice of operand version tuples.  Operators which manage multiple operands will have multiple entries in the array.  If an operator is Available, it must have at least one entry.  You must report the version of the operator itself with the name &quot;operator&quot;.

  - `version`



[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]

| Property | Type | Description

| `name`
| `string`
| name is the name of the particular operand this version is for.  It usually matches container images, not operators.

| `version`
| `string`
| version indicates which version of a particular operand is currently being manage.  It must always match the Available condition.  If 1.0.0 is Available, then this must indicate 1.0.0 even if the operator is trying to rollout 1.1.0
