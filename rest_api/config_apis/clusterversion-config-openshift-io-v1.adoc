Description::
  ClusterVersion is the configuration for the ClusterVersionOperator. This is where parameters related to automatic updates can be set.

Type::
  `object`

Required::
  - `spec`


== Specification

[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `.apiVersion`
| `string`
| APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources

| `.kind`
| `string`
| Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds

| `.metadata`
| xref:../objects/index.adoc#objectmeta-meta-v1[`ObjectMeta meta/v1`]
| Standard object's metadata. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata

| `.spec`
| `object`
| spec is the desired state of the cluster version - the operator will work to ensure that the desired version is applied to the cluster.

| `.status`
| `object`
| status contains information about the available updates and any in-progress updates.

|===
..spec
Description::
  spec is the desired state of the cluster version - the operator will work to ensure that the desired version is applied to the cluster.

Type::
  `object`

Required::
  - `clusterID`



[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `channel`
| `string`
| channel is an identifier for explicitly requesting that a non-default set of updates be applied to this cluster. The default channel will be contain stable updates that are appropriate for production clusters.

| `clusterID`
| `string`
| clusterID uniquely identifies this cluster. This is expected to be an RFC4122 UUID value (xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx in hexadecimal values). This is a required field.

| `desiredUpdate`
| `object`
| desiredUpdate is an optional field that indicates the desired value of the cluster version. Setting this value will trigger an upgrade (if the current version does not match the desired version). The set of recommended update values is listed as part of available updates in status, and setting values outside that range may cause the upgrade to fail. You may specify the version field without setting image if an update exists with that version in the availableUpdates or history. 
 If an upgrade fails the operator will halt and report status about the failing component. Setting the desired update value back to the previous version will cause a rollback to be attempted. Not all rollbacks will succeed.

| `overrides`
| `array`
| overrides is list of overides for components that are managed by cluster version operator. Marking a component unmanaged will prevent the operator from creating or updating the object.

| `overrides[]`
| `object`
| ComponentOverride allows overriding cluster version operator's behavior for a component.

| `upstream`
| `string`
| upstream may be used to specify the preferred update server. By default it will use the appropriate update server for the cluster and region.

|===
..spec.desiredUpdate
Description::
  desiredUpdate is an optional field that indicates the desired value of the cluster version. Setting this value will trigger an upgrade (if the current version does not match the desired version). The set of recommended update values is listed as part of available updates in status, and setting values outside that range may cause the upgrade to fail. You may specify the version field without setting image if an update exists with that version in the availableUpdates or history. 
 If an upgrade fails the operator will halt and report status about the failing component. Setting the desired update value back to the previous version will cause a rollback to be attempted. Not all rollbacks will succeed.

Type::
  `object`




[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `force`
| `boolean`
| force allows an administrator to update to an image that has failed verification, does not appear in the availableUpdates list, or otherwise would be blocked by normal protections on update. This option should only be used when the authenticity of the provided image has been verified out of band because the provided image will run with full administrative access to the cluster. Do not use this flag with images that comes from unknown or potentially malicious sources. 
 This flag does not override other forms of consistency checking that are required before a new update is deployed.

| `image`
| `string`
| image is a container image location that contains the update. When this field is part of spec, image is optional if version is specified and the availableUpdates field contains a matching version.

| `version`
| `string`
| version is a semantic versioning identifying the update version. When this field is part of spec, version is optional if image is specified.

| conditions provides information about the cluster version. The condition "Available" is set to true if the desiredUpdate has been reached. The condition "Progressing" is set to true if an update is being applied. The condition "Degraded" is set to true if an update is currently blocked by a temporary or permanent error. Conditions are only valid for the current desiredUpdate when metadata.generation is equal to status.generation.

The newest update is first in the list and it is ordered by recency. Updates in the history have state Completed if the rollout completed - if an update was failing or halfway applied the state will be Partial. Only a limited amount of update history is preserved.

| `history[]`
| `object`
| UpdateHistory is a single attempted update to the cluster.

| `observedGeneration`
| `integer`
| observedGeneration reports which version of the spec is being synced. If this value is not equal to metadata.generation, then the desired and conditions fields may represent a previous version.
