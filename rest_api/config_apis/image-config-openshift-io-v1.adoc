Description::
  Image governs policies related to imagestream imports and runtime configuration for external registries. It allows cluster admins to configure which registries OpenShift is allowed to import images from, extra CA trust bundles for external registries, and policies to block or allow registry hostnames. When exposing OpenShift&#x27;s image registry to the public, this also lets cluster admins specify the external hostname.

  - `spec`


== Specification

[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `.apiVersion`
| `string`
| APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources

| `.kind`
| `string`
| Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds

| `.metadata`
| xref:../objects/index.adoc#objectmeta-meta-v1[`ObjectMeta meta/v1`]
| Standard object's metadata. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata

| `.spec`
| `object`
| spec holds user settable values for configuration

| `.status`
| `object`
| status holds observed values from the cluster. They may not be overridden.

| Property | Type | Description

| `additionalTrustedCA`
| `object`
| additionalTrustedCA is a reference to a ConfigMap containing additional CAs that should be trusted during imagestream import, pod image pull, build image pull, and imageregistry pullthrough. The namespace for this config map is openshift-config.

| `allowedRegistriesForImport`
| `array`
| allowedRegistriesForImport limits the container image registries that normal users may import images from. Set this list to the registries that you trust to contain valid Docker images and that you want applications to be able to import from. Users with permission to create Images or ImageStreamMappings via the API are not affected by this policy - typically only administrators or system integrations will have those permissions.

| `allowedRegistriesForImport[]`
| `object`
| RegistryLocation contains a location of the registry specified by the registry domain name. The domain name might include wildcards, like '*' or '??'.

| `externalRegistryHostnames`
| `array (string)`
| externalRegistryHostnames provides the hostnames for the default external image registry. The external hostname should be set only when the image registry is exposed externally. The first value is used in 'publicDockerImageRepository' field in ImageStreams. The value must be in "hostname[:port]" format.

| `registrySources`
| `object`
| registrySources contains configuration that determines how the container runtime should treat individual registries when accessing images for builds+pods. (e.g. whether or not to allow insecure access).  It does not contain configuration for the internal cluster registry.

..spec.allowedRegistriesForImport[]
Description::
  RegistryLocation contains a location of the registry specified by the registry domain name. The domain name might include wildcards, like &#x27;*&#x27; or &#x27;??&#x27;.

Type::
  `object`




[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `domainName`
| `string`
| domainName specifies a domain name for the registry In case the registry use non-standard (80 or 443) port, the port should be included in the domain name as well.

| `insecure`
| `boolean`
| insecure indicates whether the registry is secure (https) or insecure (http) By default (if not specified) the registry is assumed as secure.

|===
..spec.registrySources
Description::
  registrySources contains configuration that determines how the container runtime should treat individual registries when accessing images for builds+pods. (e.g. whether or not to allow insecure access).  It does not contain configuration for the internal cluster registry.

| Property | Type | Description

| `allowedRegistries`
| `array (string)`
| allowedRegistries are the only registries permitted for image pull and push actions. All other registries are denied. 
 Only one of BlockedRegistries or AllowedRegistries may be set.

| `blockedRegistries`
| `array (string)`
| blockedRegistries cannot be used for image pull and push actions. All other registries are permitted. 
 Only one of BlockedRegistries or AllowedRegistries may be set.

| `insecureRegistries`
| `array (string)`
| insecureRegistries are registries which do not have a valid TLS certificates or only support HTTP connections.

| `externalRegistryHostnames`
| `array (string)`
| externalRegistryHostnames provides the hostnames for the default external image registry. The external hostname should be set only when the image registry is exposed externally. The first value is used in 'publicDockerImageRepository' field in ImageStreams. The value must be in "hostname[:port]" format.

| `internalRegistryHostname`
| `string`
| internalRegistryHostname sets the hostname for the default internal image registry. The value must be in "hostname[:port]" format. This value is set by the image registry operator which controls the internal registry hostname. For backward compatibility, users can still use OPENSHIFT_DEFAULT_REGISTRY environment variable but this setting overrides the environment variable.
