Description::
  Network holds cluster-wide information about Network. The canonical name is &#x60;cluster&#x60;. It is used to configure the desired network configuration, such as: IP address pools for services/pod IPs, network plugin, etc. Please view network.spec for an explanation on what applies when configuring this resource.

Type::
  `object`

Required::
  - `spec`

| Property | Type | Description

| `.apiVersion`
| `string`
| APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources

| `.kind`
| `string`
| Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds

| `.metadata`
| xref:../objects/index.adoc#objectmeta-meta-v1[`ObjectMeta meta/v1`]
| Standard object's metadata. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata

| `.spec`
| `object`
| spec holds user settable values for configuration. As a general rule, this SHOULD NOT be read directly. Instead, you should consume the NetworkStatus, as it indicates the currently deployed configuration. Currently, most spec fields are immutable after installation. Please view the individual ones for further details on each.

| `.status`
| `object`
| status holds observed values from the cluster. They may not be overridden.

| Property | Type | Description

| `clusterNetwork`
| `array`
| IP address pool to use for pod IPs. This field is immutable after installation.

| `clusterNetwork[]`
| `object`
| ClusterNetworkEntry is a contiguous block of IP addresses from which pod IPs are allocated.

| `externalIP`
| `object`
| externalIP defines configuration for controllers that affect Service.ExternalIP. If nil, then ExternalIP is not allowed to be set.

| `networkType`
| `string`
| NetworkType is the plugin that is to be deployed (e.g. OpenShiftSDN). This should match a value that the cluster-network-operator understands, or else no networking will be installed. Currently supported values are: - OpenShiftSDN This field is immutable after installation.

| `serviceNetwork`
| `array (string)`
| IP address pool for services. Currently, we only support a single entry here. This field is immutable after installation.

|===
..spec.clusterNetwork
Description::
  IP address pool to use for pod IPs. This field is immutable after installation.

Type::
  `array`




..spec.clusterNetwork[]
Description::
  ClusterNetworkEntry is a contiguous block of IP addresses from which pod IPs are allocated.

Type::
  `object`




[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `cidr`
| `string`
| The complete block for pod IPs.

| `hostPrefix`
| `integer`
| The size (prefix) of block to allocate to each node.

|===
..spec.externalIP
Description::
  externalIP defines configuration for controllers that affect Service.ExternalIP. If nil, then ExternalIP is not allowed to be set.

Type::
  `object`




[cols="1,1,1",options="header"]
|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `autoAssignCIDRs`
| `array (string)`
| autoAssignCIDRs is a list of CIDRs from which to automatically assign Service.ExternalIP. These are assigned when the service is of type LoadBalancer. In general, this is only useful for bare-metal clusters. In Openshift 3.x, this was misleadingly called "IngressIPs". Automatically assigned External IPs are not affected by any ExternalIPPolicy rules. Currently, only one entry may be provided.

| `policy`
| `object`
| policy is a set of restrictions applied to the ExternalIP field. If nil or empty, then ExternalIP is not allowed to be set.

|===
..spec.externalIP.policy
Description::
  policy is a set of restrictions applied to the ExternalIP field. If nil or empty, then ExternalIP is not allowed to be set.

Type::

|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `allowedCIDRs`
| `array (string)`
| allowedCIDRs is the list of allowed CIDRs.

| `rejectedCIDRs`
| `array (string)`
| rejectedCIDRs is the list of disallowed CIDRs. These take precedence over allowedCIDRs.

|===
..status
Description::
  status holds observed values from the cluster. They may not be overridden.
