This can be used to provide different probe parameters at the beginning of a Pod's lifecycle, when it might take a long time to load data or warm a cache, than during steady-state operation. This cannot be updated. This is a beta feature enabled by the StartupProbe feature flag. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle#container-probes

| `.stdin`
| `boolean`
| Whether this container should allocate a buffer for stdin in the container runtime. If this is not set, reads from stdin in the container will always result in EOF. Default is false.

| `.stdinOnce`
| `boolean`
| Whether the container runtime should close the stdin channel after it has been opened by a single attach. When stdin is true the stdin stream will remain open across multiple attach sessions. If stdinOnce is set to true, stdin is opened on container start, is empty until the first client attaches to stdin, and then remains open and accepts data until the client disconnects, at which time stdin is closed and remains closed until the container is restarted. If this flag is false, a container processes that reads from stdin will never receive an EOF. Default is false

| Property | Type | Description

| `.labelSelector`
| xref:../objects/index.adoc#labelselector-meta-v1[`LabelSelector meta/v1`]
| LabelSelector is used to find matching pods. Pods that match this label selector are counted to determine the number of pods in their corresponding topology domain.

| `.maxSkew`
| `integer`
| MaxSkew describes the degree to which pods may be unevenly distributed. It's the maximum permitted difference between the number of matching pods in any two topology domains of a given topology type. For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same labelSelector spread as 1/1/0: \| zone1 \| zone2 \| zone3 \| \|   P   \|   P   \|       \| - if MaxSkew is 1, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone3 to become 1/1/1; scheduling it onto zone1(zone2) would make the ActualSkew(2-0) on zone1(zone2) violate MaxSkew(1). - if MaxSkew is 2, incoming pod can be scheduled onto any zone. It's a required field. Default value is 1 and 0 is not allowed.

| `.topologyKey`

| TopologyKey is the key of node labels. Nodes that have a label with this key and identical values are considered to be in the same topology. We consider each <key, value> as a "bucket", and try to put balanced number of pods into each bucket. It's a required field.

| `.whenUnsatisfiable`
| `string`
| WhenUnsatisfiable indicates how to deal with a pod if it doesn't satisfy the spread constraint. - DoNotSchedule (default) tells the scheduler not to schedule it - ScheduleAnyway tells the scheduler to still schedule it It's considered as "Unsatisfiable" if and only if placing incoming pod on any topology violates "MaxSkew". For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same labelSelector spread as 3/1/1: \| zone1 \| zone2 \| zone3 \| \| P P P \|   P   \|   P   \| If WhenUnsatisfiable is set to DoNotSchedule, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone2(zone3) to become 3/2/1(3/1/2) as ActualSkew(2-1) on zone2(zone3) satisfies MaxSkew(1). In other words, the cluster can still be imbalanced, but scheduler won't make it *more* imbalanced. It's a required field.

[id="quantity-api-resource"]
== Quantity [api/resource]


Description::
  Quantity is a fixed-point representation of a number. It provides convenient marshaling/unmarshaling in JSON and YAML, in addition to String() and AsInt64() accessors.

The serialization format is:

&lt;quantity&gt;        ::&#x3D; &lt;signedNumber&gt;&lt;suffix&gt;
  (Note that &lt;suffix&gt; may be empty, from the &quot;&quot; case in &lt;decimalSI&gt;.)
&lt;digit&gt;           ::&#x3D; 0 \| 1 \| ... \| 9 &lt;digits&gt;          ::&#x3D; &lt;digit&gt; \| &lt;digit&gt;&lt;digits&gt; &lt;number&gt;          ::&#x3D; &lt;digits&gt; \| &lt;digits&gt;.&lt;digits&gt; \| &lt;digits&gt;. \| .&lt;digits&gt; &lt;sign&gt;            ::&#x3D; &quot;+&quot; \| &quot;-&quot; &lt;signedNumber&gt;    ::&#x3D; &lt;number&gt; \| &lt;sign&gt;&lt;number&gt; &lt;suffix&gt;          ::&#x3D; &lt;binarySI&gt; \| &lt;decimalExponent&gt; \| &lt;decimalSI&gt; &lt;binarySI&gt;        ::&#x3D; Ki \| Mi \| Gi \| Ti \| Pi \| Ei
  (International System of units; See: http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/binary.html)
&lt;decimalSI&gt;       ::&#x3D; m \| &quot;&quot; \| k \| M \| G \| T \| P \| E
  (Note that 1024 &#x3D; 1Ki but 1000 &#x3D; 1k; I didn&#x27;t choose the capitalization.)
&lt;decimalExponent&gt; ::&#x3D; &quot;e&quot; &lt;signedNumber&gt; \| &quot;E&quot; &lt;signedNumber&gt;

No matter which of the three exponent forms is used, no quantity may represent a number greater than 2^63-1 in magnitude, nor may it have more than 3 decimal places. Numbers larger or more precise will be capped or rounded up. (E.g.: 0.1m will rounded up to 1m.) This may be extended in the future if we require larger or smaller quantities.

When a Quantity is parsed from a string, it will remember the type of suffix it had, and will use the same type again when it is serialized.

Before serializing, Quantity will be put in &quot;canonical form&quot;. This means that Exponent/suffix will be adjusted up or down (with a corresponding increase or decrease in Mantissa) such that:
  a. No precision is lost
  b. No fractional digits will be emitted
  c. The exponent (or suffix) is as large as possible.
The sign will be omitted unless the number is negative.

Examples:
  1.5 will be serialized as &quot;1500m&quot;
  1.5Gi will be serialized as &quot;1536Mi&quot;

Note that the quantity will NEVER be internally represented by a floating point number. That is the whole point of this exercise.

Non-canonical values will still parse as long as they are well formed, but will be re-emitted in their canonical form. (So always use canonical form, or don&#x27;t diff.)

This format is intended to make it difficult to use these numbers without writing some sort of special handling code in the hopes that that will cause implementors to also use a fixed point implementation.

Type::
  `string`



[id="fieldsv1-meta-v1"]
== FieldsV1 [meta/v1]


Description::
  FieldsV1 stores a set of fields in a data structure like a Trie, in JSON format.

Each key is either a &#x27;.&#x27; representing the field itself, and will always map to an empty set, or a string representing a sub-field or item. The string will follow one of these four formats: &#x27;f:&lt;name&gt;&#x27;, where &lt;name&gt; is the name of a field in a struct, or key in a map &#x27;v:&lt;value&gt;&#x27;, where &lt;value&gt; is the exact json formatted value of a list item &#x27;i:&lt;index&gt;&#x27;, where &lt;index&gt; is position of a item in a list &#x27;k:&lt;keys&gt;&#x27;, where &lt;keys&gt; is a map of  a list item&#x27;s key fields to their unique values If a key maps to an empty Fields value, the field that key represents is part of the set.

The exact format is defined in sigs.k8s.io/structured-merge-diff

|===
| Property | Type | Description

| `.continue`
| `string`
| continue may be set if the user set a limit on the number of items returned, and indicates that the server has more data available. The value is opaque and may be used to issue another request to the endpoint that served this list to retrieve the next set of available objects. Continuing a consistent list may not be possible if the server configuration has changed or more than a few minutes have passed. The resourceVersion field returned when using this continue value will be identical to the value in the first response, unless you have received this token from an error message.

| `.remainingItemCount`
| `integer`
| remainingItemCount is the number of subsequent items in the list which are not included in this list response. If the list request contained label or field selectors, then the number of remaining items is unknown and the field will be left unset and omitted during serialization. If the list is complete (either because it is not chunking or because this is the last chunk), then there are no more remaining items and this field will be left unset and omitted during serialization. Servers older than v1.15 do not set this field. The intended use of the remainingItemCount is *estimating* the size of a collection. Clients should not rely on the remainingItemCount to be set or to be exact.

| `.resourceVersion`
| `string`
| String that identifies the server's internal version of this object that can be used by clients to determine when objects have changed. Value must be treated as opaque by clients and passed unmodified back to the server. Populated by the system. Read-only.

The resource is expected to be deleted (no longer visible from resource lists, and not reachable by name) after the time in this field, once the finalizers list is empty. As long as the finalizers list contains items, deletion is blocked. Once the deletionTimestamp is set, this value may not be unset or be set further into the future, although it may be shortened or the resource may be deleted prior to this time. For example, a user may request that a pod is deleted in 30 seconds. The Kubelet will react by sending a graceful termination signal to the containers in the pod. After that 30 seconds, the Kubelet will send a hard termination signal (SIGKILL) to the container and after cleanup, remove the pod from the API. In the presence of network partitions, this object may still exist after this timestamp, until an administrator or automated process can determine the resource is fully terminated. If not set, graceful deletion of the object has not been requested.

Populated by the system when a graceful deletion is requested. Read-only. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata

| `.finalizers`
| `array (string)`
| Must be empty before the object is deleted from the registry. Each entry is an identifier for the responsible component that will remove the entry from the list. If the deletionTimestamp of the object is non-nil, entries in this list can only be removed. Finalizers may be processed and removed in any order.  Order is NOT enforced because it introduces significant risk of stuck finalizers. finalizers is a shared field, any actor with permission can reorder it. If the finalizer list is processed in order, then this can lead to a situation in which the component responsible for the first finalizer in the list is waiting for a signal (field value, external system, or other) produced by a component responsible for a finalizer later in the list, resulting in a deadlock. Without enforced ordering finalizers are free to order amongst themselves and are not vulnerable to ordering changes in the list.

| `.generateName`
| `string`
| GenerateName is an optional prefix, used by the server, to generate a unique name ONLY IF the Name field has not been provided. If this field is used, the name returned to the client will be different than the name passed. This value will also be combined with a unique suffix. The provided value has the same validation rules as the Name field, and may be truncated by the length of the suffix required to make the value unique on the server.

If this field is specified and the generated name exists, the server will NOT return a 409 - instead, it will either return 201 Created or 500 with Reason ServerTimeout indicating a unique name could not be found in the time allotted, and the client should retry (optionally after the time indicated in the Retry-After header).

Applied only if Name is not specified. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#idempotency

| `.generation`
| `integer`
| A sequence number representing a specific generation of the desired state. Populated by the system. Read-only.

| `.labels`
| `object (string)`
| Map of string keys and values that can be used to organize and categorize (scope and select) objects. May match selectors of replication controllers and services. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/labels

| `.managedFields`
| xref:../objects/index.adoc#managedfieldsentry-meta-v1[`array (ManagedFieldsEntry meta/v1)`]
| ManagedFields maps workflow-id and version to the set of fields that are managed by that workflow. This is mostly for internal housekeeping, and users typically shouldn't need to set or understand this field. A workflow can be the user's name, a controller's name, or the name of a specific apply path like "ci-cd". The set of fields is always in the version that the workflow used when modifying the object.

| `.name`
| `string`
| Name must be unique within a namespace. Is required when creating resources, although some resources may allow a client to request the generation of an appropriate name automatically. Name is primarily intended for creation idempotence and configuration definition. Cannot be updated. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/identifiers#names

| `.namespace`
| `string`
| Namespace defines the space within each name must be unique. An empty namespace is equivalent to the "default" namespace, but "default" is the canonical representation. Not all objects are required to be scoped to a namespace - the value of this field for those objects will be empty.

Must be a DNS_LABEL. Cannot be updated. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/namespaces

| `.ownerReferences`
| xref:../objects/index.adoc#ownerreference-meta-v1[`array (OwnerReference meta/v1)`]
| List of objects depended by this object. If ALL objects in the list have been deleted, this object will be garbage collected. If this object is managed by a controller, then an entry in this list will point to this controller, with the controller field set to true. There cannot be more than one managing controller.

| `.resourceVersion`
| `string`
| An opaque value that represents the internal version of this object that can be used by clients to determine when objects have changed. May be used for optimistic concurrency, change detection, and the watch operation on a resource or set of resources. Clients must treat these values as opaque and passed unmodified back to the server. They may only be valid for a particular resource or set of resources.

Populated by the system. Read-only. Value must be treated as opaque by clients and . More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#concurrency-control-and-consistency

| `.selfLink`
| `string`
| SelfLink is a URL representing this object. Populated by the system. Read-only.

DEPRECATED Kubernetes will stop propagating this field in 1.20 release and the field is planned to be removed in 1.21 release.

| `.uid`
| `string`
| UID is the unique in time and space value for this object. It is typically generated by the server on successful creation of a resource and is not allowed to change on PUT operations.

Populated by the system. Read-only. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/identifiers#uids

[id="time-meta-v1"]
== Time [meta/v1]


Description::
  Time is a wrapper around time.Time which supports correct marshaling to YAML and JSON.  Wrappers are provided for many of the factory methods that the time package offers.

Type::
  `string`



[id="rawextension-pkg-runtime"]
== RawExtension [pkg/runtime]


Description::
  RawExtension is used to hold extensions in external versions.

To use this, make a field which has RawExtension as its type in your external, versioned struct, and Object in your internal struct. You also need to register your various plugin types.

// Internal package: type MyAPIObject struct {
	runtime.TypeMeta &#x60;json:&quot;,inline&quot;&#x60;
	MyPlugin runtime.Object &#x60;json:&quot;myPlugin&quot;&#x60;
} type PluginA struct {
	AOption string &#x60;json:&quot;aOption&quot;&#x60;
}

// External package: type MyAPIObject struct {
	runtime.TypeMeta &#x60;json:&quot;,inline&quot;&#x60;
	MyPlugin runtime.RawExtension &#x60;json:&quot;myPlugin&quot;&#x60;
} type PluginA struct {
	AOption string &#x60;json:&quot;aOption&quot;&#x60;
}

// On the wire, the JSON will look something like this: {
	&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;MyAPIObject&quot;,
	&quot;apiVersion&quot;:&quot;v1&quot;,
	&quot;myPlugin&quot;: {
		&quot;kind&quot;:&quot;PluginA&quot;,
		&quot;aOption&quot;:&quot;foo&quot;,
	},
}

So what happens? Decode first uses json or yaml to unmarshal the serialized data into your external MyAPIObject. That causes the raw JSON to be stored, but not unpacked. The next step is to copy (using pkg/conversion) into the internal struct. The runtime package&#x27;s DefaultScheme has conversion functions installed which will unpack the JSON stored in RawExtension, turning it into the correct object type, and storing it in the Object. (TODO: In the case where the object is of an unknown type, a runtime.Unknown object will be created and stored.)

Type::
  `object`



[id="intorstring-util-intstr"]
== IntOrString [util/intstr]


Description::
  IntOrString is a type that can hold an int32 or a string.  When used in JSON or YAML marshalling and unmarshalling, it produces or consumes the inner type.  This allows you to have, for example, a JSON field that can accept a name or number.

Type::
  `string`
