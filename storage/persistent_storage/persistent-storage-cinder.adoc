{product-title} supports OpenStack Cinder.  Some familiarity with Kubernetes and OpenStack is assumed.

Cinder volumes can be provisioned dynamically.
Persistent volumes are not bound to a single project or namespace; they can be
shared across the {product-title} cluster.
Persistent volume claims are specific to a project or namespace and can be
requested by users.

For {product-title}, automatic migration from OpenStack Cinder in-tree to the Container Storage Interface (CSI) driver is available as a Technology Preview (TP) feature.
With migration enabled, volumes provisioned using the existing in-tree plug-in are automatically migrated to use the OpenStack Cinder CSI driver. For more information, see xref:../container_storage_interface/persistent-storage-csi-migration.adoc#persistent-storage-csi-migration[CSI automatic migration feature].
