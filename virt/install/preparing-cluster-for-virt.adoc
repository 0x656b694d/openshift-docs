Before you install {VirtProductName}, ensure that your {product-title} cluster meets the following requirements:

* Your cluster must be installed on
xref:../../installing/installing_bare_metal/installing-bare-metal.adoc#installing-bare-metal[bare metal] infrastructure with Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS workers.

* You must manage your Compute nodes according to the number and size of the virtual machines that you want to host in the cluster.

* To deploy {VirtProductName} in a disconnected environment, you must xref:../../operators/admin/olm-restricted-networks.adoc#olm-restricted-networks[configure Operator Lifecycle Manager on restricted networks].

* To use proxy with {VirtProductName}, you must xref:../../operators/admin/olm-configuring-proxy-support.adoc#olm-configuring-proxy-support[configure proxy support in Operator Lifecycle Manager].

* If your cluster uses worker nodes from multiple CPU vendors, live migration failures can occur. For example, a virtual machine with an AMD CPU might attempt to live-migrate to a node with an Intel CPU and likely fail migration. To avoid this, label nodes with a vendor-specific label, such as `Vendor=Intel` or `Vendor=AMD`, and set node affinity on your virtual machines to ensure successful migration. See xref:../../nodes/scheduling/nodes-scheduler-node-affinity.adoc#nodes-scheduler-node-affinity-configuring-required_nodes-scheduler-node-affinity[Configuring a required node affinity rule] for more information.

{VirtProductName} works with {product-title} by default, but the following installation configurations are recommended:

* Configure xref:../../monitoring/cluster_monitoring/about-cluster-monitoring.adoc#about-cluster-monitoring[monitoring] in the cluster.
