= Migrating between {product-title} 4.2 clusters

toc::[]

You can migrate application workloads between {product-title} 4.2 clusters with the Cluster Application Migration (CAM) tool. The CAM tool enables you to control the migration and to minimize application downtime.

The CAM tool's web console and API, based on Kubernetes custom resources, enable you to migrate stateful and stateless application workloads at the granularity of a namespace.

You can migrate data to a different storage class, for example, from Red Hat Gluster Storage or NFS storage to Red Hat Ceph Storage.

.Prerequisites

* You must have xref:../../cli_reference/openshift_cli/administrator-cli-commands.html#policy[`cluster-admin` privileges] on all clusters.
* You must have a replication repository that supports the S3 API and is accessible to the source and target clusters.

== Deploying the Cluster Application Migration tool

Deploying the CAM tool involves the following steps:

. Installing the CAM Operator on all clusters
+
The CAM Operator installs the Migration controller, CAM web console, Restic, and Velero on the target cluster and Restic and Velero on the source cluster(s).

. Configuring cross-origin resource sharing on the source cluster(s) to enable communication with the CAM tool
