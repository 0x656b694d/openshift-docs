A `hostPath` volume in an {product-title} cluster mounts a file or directory from the host nodeâ€™s file system into your pod. Most pods do not need a `hostPath` volume, but it does offer a quick option for testing should an application require it.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The cluster administrator must configure pods to run as privileged. This grants access to pods in the same node.
