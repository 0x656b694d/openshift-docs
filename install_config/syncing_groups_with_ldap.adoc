== Overview
As an OpenShift administrator, you may want to group users in order to better manage them, place
appropriate permissions or to enhance collaboration. Your organization may already have created such
groups and stored them in an LDAP server. OpenShift allows for you to sync those records with
internal OpenShift records so that you can focus on managing your groups in once place only.
OpenShift currently supports group sync with LDAP servers using three common schema for defining
group membership: RFC2307, Active Directory, and augmented Active Directory.

[NOTE]
====
You must have
link:../architecture/additional_concepts/authorization.html#roles[*cluster-admin*
privileges] to sync groups.
====

== Configuring an LDAP Sync Job
In order to configure an LDAP sync job, a sync configuration file will be necessary. The
configuration file contains LDAP client configuration in order to correctly connect to your LDAP
server as well as sync configuration options that are dependent on the schema used in your LDAP
server. A configuration file can furthermore contain a administrator-defined list of name mappings
so that you can decide which groups in OpenShift map to which groups in your LDAP server.

.LDAP Client Configuration
====
[source,yaml]
----
url: ldap://LDAP_SERVER_IP:389 <1>
bindDN: cn=admin,dc=example,dc=com <2>
bindPassword: admin <3>
insecure: true <4>
ca: my-ldap-ca-bundle.crt <5>
----
<1> The connection protocol, IP address of the LDAP server hosting your database, and the port to
connect to, formatted as `scheme://host:port`.
<2> The optional DN to use to bind if elevated privilege is necessary to retrieve entries for the
sync job.
<3> The optional password to use to bind if elevated privilege is necessary to retrieve entries for
the sync job.
<4> When *true*, no TLS connection is made to the server. When *false*, `ldaps://` URLs connect
using TLS, and `ldap://` URLs are upgraded to TLS.
<5> Certificate bundle to use to validate server certificates for the configured URL. If empty,
system trusted roots are used. Only applies if *insecure: false*.
====

Sync configurations consist of LDAP query definitions for all of the entries that are
required for the sync job. The specific definition of an LDAP query will depend on the schema used
to store membership information in the LDAP server.

.LDAP Query Definition
====
[source,yaml]
----
baseDN: ou=users,dc=example,dc=com <1>
scope: sub <2>
derefAliases: never <3>
timeout: 0 <4>
filter: (objectClass=intOrgPerson) <5>
----
<1> The DN of the branch of the directory where all searches should start from. At the very least,
this must be the top of your directory tree, but it could also specify a subtree in the directory.
<2> The scope of the search. Can be either either `base`, `one` or `sub`. If the scope is not
provided, the default is to use a scope of `sub`. Descriptions of the scope options are given in the
link:#ldap-search[appendix.]
<3> The behavior of the search with respect to aliases in the LDAP tree. Can be either `never`,
`search`, `base` or `always`. If the behavior is not given, the default is to `always` dereference
aliases. Descriptions of the dereferencing behaviors are given in the
link:#deref-aliases[appendix].
<4> The time limit allowed for the search by the client, in seconds. A value of 0 imposes no client-
 side limit.
<5> A valid LDAP search filter. If not provided, defaults to `(objectClass=*)`.
====

A user-defined name mapping explicitly maps names of OpenShift Groups to unique identidiers used to
find groups on your LDAP server. Normal `yaml` syntax is used to denote the mapping. A user-defined
mapping can contain an entry for every group in your LDAP server or only a subset of those groups.
If there are groups on the LDAP server that do not have a user-defined name mapping, the default
behavior of the sync job is to use the attribute specified as the group's name.

.User-Defined Name Mapping
====
[source,yaml]
----
groupUIDNameMapping:
  "cn=group1,ou=groups,dc=example,dc=com": firstgroup
  "cn=group2,ou=groups,dc=example,dc=com": secondgroup
  "cn=group3,ou=groups,dc=example,dc=com": thirdgroup
----
====

== Running an LDAP Sync Job
Once a configuration file is created for the sync job, the sync job can be started. OpenShift allows
an administrator to perform a number of different sync types with the same server. All group sync
jobs will be dry-run by default, so no changed will occur to OpenShift Group records unless
the `--confirm` flag is set on the command.

An administrator can sync all groups from the LDAP server into OpenShift:
----
$ openshift ex sync-groups --sync-config=config.yaml --confirm
----
An administrator can sync all groups already in OpenShift that correspond to the server specified
in the configuration file:
----
$ openshift ex sync-groups --type=openshift --sync-config=config.yaml --confirm
----
An administrator can sync some subset of groups using a whitelist and/or blacklist files containing
one unique group identifier per line, and/or whitelist specifiers directly in the command. Any
combination of whitelist files, whitelist literals, or blacklist files will work, for groups found
on an LDAP server, as well as groups already present in OpenShift:
----
$ openshift ex sync-groups --whitelist=whitelist.txt --sync-config=config.yaml --confirm
$ openshift ex sync-groups --blacklist=blacklist.txt --sync-config=config.yaml --confirm
$ openshift ex sync-groups group_unique_idenitifer --sync-config=config.yaml --confirm
$ openshift ex sync-groups group_unique_idenitifer   \
                           --whitelist=whitelist.txt \
                           --blacklist=blacklist.txt \
                           --sync-config=config.yaml --confirm
$ openshift ex sync-groups --type=openshift --whitelist=whitelist.txt --sync-config=config.yaml --confirm
----

== Example Sync Jobs
For all of the example sync jobs in the following sections, we will be syncing one group named
*_admins_* that has two members: *_Jane_* and *_Jim_*. Each example will show how the users and
group would be added to the LDAP server, what the LDAP sync configuration file will look like, and
what the resulting group record in OpenShift will be after the sync.

=== RFC2307 Schema
In the RFC2307 schema, both users and groups exist in the LDAP server as first-class entries and
group membership is stored in attributes on the group. The following snippet of `ldif` defines the
users and group for this schema.

.LDAP Entries Using RFC2307 Schema: `rfc2307.ldif`
====
[source,ldif]
----
  dn: ou=users,dc=example,dc=com
  objectClass: organizationalUnit
  ou: users

  dn: cn=Jane,ou=users,dc=example,dc=com
  objectClass: person
  objectClass: organizationalPerson
  objectClass: inetOrgPerson
  cn: Jane
  sn: Smith
  displayName: Jane Smith
  mail: jane.smith@example.com

  dn: cn=Jim,ou=users,dc=example,dc=com
  objectClass: person
  objectClass: organizationalPerson
  objectClass: inetOrgPerson

  sn: Adams
  displayName: Jim Adams

  dn: ou=groups,dc=example,dc=com
  objectClass: organizationalUnit
  ou: groups

  dn: cn=admins,ou=groups,dc=example,dc=com <1>
  objectClass: groupOfNames
  cn: admins
  owner: cn=admin,dc=example,dc=com
  description: System Adminstrators
  member: cn=Jane,ou=users,dc=example,dc=com <2>
  member: cn=Jim,ou=users,dc=example,dc=com
----
<1> Note that the group is a first-class entry in the LDAP server.
<2> Note that members of a group are listed with an identifying reference as attributes on the
group.
====

In order to sync this group, we need to create the correct sync configuration file. In order to
fully configure the sync job for the RFC2307 schema, we will need to provide an LDAP query
definition for both user entries and group entries, as well as the attributes we wish to represent
them with in the internal OpenShift records. In order to make the group that is created in OpenShift
as user-friendly as possible, we'll choose to use attributes other than the distinguished name
whenever possible for user- or administrator-facing fields. For instance, we'd like the users of a
group to be identified by their e-mail, and the name of the group  to be the common name. The
following configuration file creates these relationships.

.LDAP Sync Configuration Using RFC2307 Schema: `rfc2307_config.yaml`
====
[source,yaml]
----
kind: LDAPSyncConfig
apiVersion: v1
rfc2307:

    userUIDAttribute: dn <4>
    userNameAttributes: [ mail ] <5>
----
<1> The attribute used to uniquely identify a group on the LDAP server.
<2> The attribute that will be used as the name of the group.
<3> The attribute on the group that stores the membership information.
<4> The attribute used to uniquely identify a user on the LDAP server.
<5> The attribute that will be used as the name of the user in the OpenShift group record.
====

In order to run this sync job, use the following command:
----
$ openshift ex sync-groups --sync-config=rfc2307_config.yaml --confirm
----

The group record that will be created in OpenShift as a result will look like:

====

=== RFC2307 Schema With User-Defined Name Mappings
When creating a sync job with user-defined mappings, nothing changes about the storage of your group
records on the LDAP server. However, the OpenShift sync configuration file changes to contain the
user-defined mapping as shown below.

.LDAP Sync Configuration Using RFC2307 Schema With User-Defined Name Mappings: `rfc2307_config_user_defined.yaml`
====
[source,yaml]
----

 the user-defined name mapping
====

In order to run this sync job, use the following command:
----
$ openshift ex sync-groups --sync-config=rfc2307_config_user_defined.yaml --confirm
----

The group record that will be created in OpenShift as a result will look like:

=== Active Directory Schema
In the Active Directory schema, both users exist in the LDAP server as first-class entries and
group membership is stored in attributes on the user. The following snippet of `ldif` defines the
users and group for this schema.

.LDAP Entries Using Active Directory Schema: `active_directory.ldif`

  objectClass: person
  objectClass: organizationalPerson
  objectClass: inetOrgPerson
  cn: Jim
  sn: Adams
  displayName: Jim Adams
  mail: jim.adams@example.com
  memberOf: admins
----
<1> Note that groups a user is a member of are listed as attributes on the user, and the group does
not exist as an entry on the server. The `memberOf` attribute may not be a literal attribute on the
user, either, and could be created during search and returned to the client but not committed to the
database.
====

In order to sync this group, we need to create the correct sync configuration file. In order to
fully configure the sync job for the Active Directory schema, we will need to provide an LDAP query
definition for user entries, as well as the attributes we wish to represent them with in the
internal OpenShift records. In order to make the group that is created in OpenShift as user-friendly
as possible, we'll choose to use attributes other than the distinguished name whenever possible for
user- or administrator-facing fields. For instance, we'd like the users of a group to be identified
by their e-mail, but for the name of the group we are not allowed any freedom other than the name
used to identify the group on the LDAP server. The following configuration file creates these
relationships.

=== Augmented Active Directory Schema
In the augmented Active Directory schema, both users and groups exist in the LDAP server as
first-class entries and group membership is stored in attributes on the user. The following snippet
of `ldif` defines the users and group for this schema.
