toc::[]

You can update, or upgrade, an {product-title} cluster between minor versions.

[NOTE]
====
Because of the difficulty of changing update channels by using `oc`, use the web console to change the update channel. It is recommended to complete the update process within the web console. You can follow the steps in xref:../updating/updating-cluster-cli.adoc#updating-cluster-cli[Updating a cluster within a minor version by using the CLI] to complete the update after you change to a {product-version} channel.

.Prerequisites

* Access to the cluster as a user with `admin` privileges.
See xref:../authentication/using-rbac.adoc[Using RBAC to define and apply permissions].
