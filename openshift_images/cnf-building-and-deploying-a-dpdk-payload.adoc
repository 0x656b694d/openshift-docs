The Data Plane Development Kit (DPDK) base image is a base image for DPDK
applications. It uses the Source-to-Image (S2I) build tool to automate the
building of application images.

Source-to-Image (S2I) is a tool for building reproducible, Docker-formatted
container images. It produces ready-to-run images by injecting application
source into a container image and assembling a new image. The new image
incorporates the base image (the builder) and built source. For more
information, see
xref:../builds/build-strategies.adoc#build-strategy-s2i_build-strategies[Source-to-Image
(S2I) build].

The DPDK base image that comes preinstalled with DPDK, and a build tool used to
create a target image with DPDK and a user provided application.

.Prerequisites

Before using the S2I tool, ensure that you have the following components installed and configured:

* xref:../registry/configuring-registry-operator.adoc#configuring-registry-operator[Image Registry Operator].

* xref:../networking/hardware_networks/installing-sriov-operator.adoc#installing-sriov-operator[Installing the SR-IOV Network Operator].

An example DPDK-based application base on the dpdk-based image is available in
the link:https://github.com/openshift-kni/cnf-features-deploy/tree/master/tools/s2i-dpdk/test/test-app[cnf-features-deploy] repository.

This example application is the `test-pmd` application provided by dpdk.org. See the link:https://doc.dpdk.org/guides/testpmd_app_ug/[Testpmd Application User Guide].

.Procedure

To build a target image, create a repository containing an application and the following two scripts:

* `build.sh` - for building the application
* `run.sh` - for running the application

This is an example of `build.sh`:

----
#!/usr/bin/env bash

make -C test-pmd

cp test-pmd/testpmd ./customtestpmd

echo "build done"
----

This is an example of `run.sh`:

----
#!/bin/bash -eux

export CPU=$(cat /sys/fs/cgroup/cpuset/cpuset.cpus)
echo ${CPU}
echo ${PCIDEVICE_OPENSHIFT_IO_DPDKNIC}

if [ "$RUN_TYPE" == "testpmd" ]; then
envsubst < test-template.sh > test.sh
chmod +x test.sh
expect -f test.sh
fi

while true; do sleep inf; done;
----

The DPDK base image and the application repository are both used to build a target application image.
S2I copies the application from the repository to the DPDK base image, which then builds a target image using
DPDK base image resources and the copied application.

You can use the {product-title} BuildConfig to build a target image in a production environment.
A sample manifest file for building the sample DPDK application described above is available in the
link:https://github.com/openshift-kni/cnf-features-deploy/blob/master/feature-configs/demo/dpdk/build-config.yaml[build-config.yaml] file.

The `build-config.yaml` file is the file you use to create your automated build.
It creates a new `dpdk` namespace and configures an `ImageStream` for the image
and starts a build.

<1> The `kind` type specifies the defined image stream.

<2> The `output` type publishes the result of the image stream object.

<3> The `source` type contains the git repository and a context directory within the repository.

<4> The `strategy` type contains a DPDK base image.

It is the `source` type and `strategy` type that build the image.

A complete guide to using BuildConfigs is available in
xref:../builds/understanding-buildconfigs.adoc#understanding-buildconfigs[Understanding
build configurations].

After the base DPDK image build is ready, create a new directory with a
`kustomization.yaml` file and a `build-config.yaml` patch.

This is an example of `kustomization.yaml`:

----
apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Kustomization
