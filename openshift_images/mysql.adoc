== Overview
The OpenShift MySQL database image https://github.com/openshift/mysql[repository] contains the sources and Dockerfiles for building MySQL database images. The resulting images can be run by Docker.

== Versions
Currently supported versions of MySQL:

* https://github.com/openshift/mysql/tree/master/5.5[5.5]

== Base Images

* RHEL-7
* CentOS-7

[NOTE]
====
RHEL-7 image is not available at https://registry.hub.docker.com/[Docker Hub]. In order to perform build action on a RHEL-7 based MySQL image, you need to run the build on properly subscribed RHEL-7 machine.
====

== Installation
To build MySQL image, choose between the CentOS7 or RHEL7 base image:

=== RHEL-7 base image

----
$ git clone https://github.com/openshift/mysql.git
$ cd mysql
$ make build TARGET=rhel7 VERSION=5.5
----

=== CentOS-7 base image

----
$ git clone https://github.com/openshift/mysql.git
$ cd mysql
$ make build VERSION=5.5
----

[NOTE]
====
By omitting the `VERSION` parameter, the build action will be performed on all the supported versions of MySQL. Since we are now supporting only version `5.5`, you can omit this parameter.
====

== Usage
To create a container running MySQL, you need to run following commands.

=== RHEL-7 image

----
$ docker run -d --name mysql_database -e MYSQL_USER=user -e MYSQL_PASSWORD=pass -e MYSQL_DATABASE=db -p 3306:3306 openshift/mysql-55-rhel7
----

=== CentOS-7 image

----
$ docker run -d --name mysql_database -e MYSQL_USER=user -e MYSQL_PASSWORD=pass -e MYSQL_DATABASE=db -p 3306:3306 openshift/mysql-55-centos7
----

This will create a container named `mysql_database`, with credentials `user:pass` and database `db`. To access and test if the application is running, run:
----
$ mysql -h 127.0.0.1 -uuser -ppass <<< "SELECT 1;"
----

To properly stop the container:
----
$ docker stop mysql_database
----

== Environment variables

* *MYSQL_USER* - This variable specifies username for database user that
    will be created for your application to use.

* *MYSQL_PASSWORD* - Password for the *MYSQL_USER*.

* *MYSQL_DATABASE* - Name of the database that will be created. *MYSQL_USER*
    will have full rights to the database.

* *MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD* - Password for the root user. This variable is optional. If not set, remote login to the root account will not be possible. Local connections from inside the container are always allowed without a password.

== Volumes

* */var/lib/mysql/data* - This is the data directory where MySQL stores database files.
