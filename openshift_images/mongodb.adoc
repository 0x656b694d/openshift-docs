== Overview
The OpenShift https://github.com/openshift/mongodb/tree/master[MongoDB] image repository contains the sources and Dockerfiles for building various versions of MongoDB images.

== Versions
Currently, OpenShift only supports version https://github.com/openshift/mongodb/tree/master/2.4[2.4] of MongoDB.

== Base Images

* RHEL-7
* CentOS-7

[NOTE]
====
In order to perform build or test action on a RHEL-7 based MongoDB image, you need to run the build on properly subscribed RHEL-7 machine.
====

== Installation
To build MongoDB image, select either a RHEL7 or CentOS7 base image:

=== RHEL-7 Base Image

----
$ git clone https://github.com/openshift/mongodb.git
$ cd mongodb
$ make build TARGET=rhel7 VERSION=2.4
----

=== CentOS-7 Base Image

This image is also available on DockerHub. To download it use:

----
docker pull openshift/mongodb-24-centos7
----

To build MongoDB image from scratch use:

----
$ git clone https://github.com/openshift/mongodb.git
$ cd mongodb
$ make build VERSION=2.4
----

[NOTE]
====
If you omit the `VERSION` parameter, the build/test action is performed on all supported versions of MongoDB. Since version `2.4` is the only version supported, you can omit this parameter.
====


== Usage

=== Environment variables

The image recognizes following environment variables that you can set
during initialization, by passing `-e VAR=VALUE` to the Docker run
command.

.Repository Organization
[cols="4a,6a",options="header"]
|===

|Variable name |Description

|`MONGODB_USERNAME`
|User name for MONGODB account to be created

|`MONGODB_PASSWORD`
|Password for the user account

|`MONGODB_DATABASE`
|Database name

|`MONGODB_ROOT_PASSWORD`
|Password for the root user (optional)
|===

You can also set following mount points by passing `-v /host:/container` flag to Docker.

.Volumes
[cols="3a,3a",options="header"]
|===

|Volume mount point |Description

|`/var/lib/mongodb/`
|MongoDB data directory
|===

MongoDB settings can be configured by additional environment variables.

.Additional MongoDB settings
[cols="3a,6a,1a",options="header"]
|===

|Variable name |Description |Default

|`MONGODB_NOPREALLOC`
|Disable data file preallocation.
|true

|`MONGODB_SMALLFILES`
|Set MongoDB to use a smaller default data file size.
|true

|`MONGODB_QUITE`
|Runs MongoDB in a quiet mode that attempts to limit the amount of output.
|true
|===

=== MongoDB root user
The root user is not set by default. You can create one by setting
`MONGODB_ROOT_PASSWORD` environment variable, in which case the root 
user name will be set to `admin`. This process is done upon initializing 
the database.

=== Running images

==== RHEL 7 Base Image

----
docker run -d -e MONGODB_USERNAME=<user> -e MONGODB_PASSWORD=<password> -e MONGODB_DATABASE=<database>  openshift/mongodb-24-rhel7
----

==== CentOS 7 Base Image

----
docker run -d -e MONGODB_USERNAME=<user> -e MONGODB_PASSWORD=<password> -e MONGODB_DATABASE=<database>  openshift/mongodb-24-centos7
----

=== Shared volumes

We will assume that you are using the `openshift/mongodb-24-centos7`
image. Suppose you want to set only mandatory required environment
variables and store the database in the `/home/user/database`
directory on the host filesystem, you need to execute the following
command:

----
docker run -d -e MONGODB_USERNAME=<user> -e MONGODB_PASSWORD=<password> -e MONGODB_DATABASE=<database> -v /home/user/database:/var/lib/mongodb openshift/mongodb-24-centos7
----

==== Initializing database

If you are initializing the database and it's the first time you are using the 
specified shared volume, the database will be created, together with database
administrator user and also MongoDB root user if `MONGODB_ADMIN_PASSWORD`
environment variable is specified. After that the MongoDB daemon will be
started.
If you are re-attaching the volume to another container the creation of the
database user and the admin user will be skipped and only the mongodb
daemon will be started.

== Note about Software Collections

We use https://www.softwarecollections.org/[Software Collections] to
install and launch MongoDB. If you want to execute a MongoDB command 
inside of a running container (eg. for debugging), you need
to prefix it with `scl enable mongodb24` command. Some examples:

----
# Running mongodb commands inside the container
scl enable mongodb24 -- mongo <db_name> -u <username> -p <password>

# Executing a command inside a running container from host
# Note: You will be able to run mongodb commands without invoking the scl commands
docker exec -it <CONTAINER_ID> scl enable mongodb24 /bin/bash
----

= Test Framework

This repository also provides test framework, which checks basic functionality of the MongoDB image.

User can choose between testing MongoDB based on RHEL or CentOS image.

== RHEL 7 Base Image

To test a rhel7-based MongoDB image, you need to run the test on a properly subscribed RHEL machine.

----
$ cd mongodb
$ make test TARGET=rhel7 VERSION=2.4
----

== CentOS 7 Base Image

----
$ cd mongodb
$ make test VERSION=2.4
----

[NOTE]
====
If you omit the `VERSION` parameter, the build/test action is performed on all supported versions of MongoDB. Since we are only supporting `2.4` version, you can omit this parameter.
