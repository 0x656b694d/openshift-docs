toc::[]

When {product-title} is installed on restricted networks, Operator Lifecycle
Manager (OLM) can no longer use the default OperatorHub sources because they
require full Internet connectivity. Cluster administrators can disable those
default sources and create local mirrors so that OLM can install and manage
Operators from the local sources instead.

[IMPORTANT]
====
While OLM can manage Operators from local sources, the ability for a given
Operator to run successfully in a restricted network still depends on the
Operator itself. See the following Red Hat Knowledgebase Article for details on
Operators that support running in disconnected mode:
