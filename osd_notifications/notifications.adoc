Cluster service logs can be viewed through {OCM} and the OCM CLI. The cluster history will detail cluster events such as adding groups, adding users, adding identity providers, load balancer quota updates, scheduled maintenance upgrades, and so much more.

In addition to the cluster history on OCM, users subscribed to cluster notifications will also receive emails for cluster upgrade maintenance, known cluster incidents, or customer action required cluster events.
